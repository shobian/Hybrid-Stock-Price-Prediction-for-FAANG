The world's richest people saw their net worth once again skyrocket as the stock market surged on Wednesday following the news that President Donald Trump had rolled back his aggressive tariff plan that had, in recent weeks, sent the market into a tailspin.

Together, the top 10 wealthiest people saw a combined $135.33 billion rally in their personal fortunes on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire index.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk saw the largest single-day gains, raking in $35.9 billion alone, and French billionaire Bernard Arnault was the only one of the top 10 to keep registering losses, slipping down the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index list with a $5.7 billion loss. He's also the only non-American on the list.

Still, while Wednesday's market rally reshuffled the rankings, the world's wealthiest people have lost a combined $244.36 billion so far this year.

Here's where their fortunes stood after Wednesday's market close, according to the index.

1. Elon Musk

Net worth: $326 billion

1-day change: up $35.9 billion

Year-to-date change: down $107 billion

Of the top 10 list's names, Elon Musk gained the most on Wednesday, seeing personal gains of $35.9 billion during the market rally. Year to date, he's still registering $107 billion in losses.

While his net worth has fluctuated wildly in recent months, Musk has maintained his status as the world's richest person despite facing increasing anger for his proximity to the White House's DOGE agency, which has spearheaded cost-cutting across the federal government, and public backlash against Tesla. The backlash coincided with a downturn in the electric vehicle company's stock.

Musk's wealth stems primarily from his stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. His other businesses include Neuralink, X, The Boring Company, and xAI.

2. Jeff Bezos

Net worth: $210 billion

1-day change: up $18.5 billion

Year-to-date change: down $28.7 billion

Jeff Bezos , the founder and executive chairman of Amazon, who stepped down as CEO in 2021, saw his personal wealth increase by $18.5 billion on Wednesday — though he's still down to $28.7 billion this year.

In addition to his role at Amazon, Bezos also owns The Washington Post, which he purchased in 2013. The news outlet has seen an exodus of subscribers in recent months as Bezos has ordered the paper's editors not to make a presidential endorsement , and announced that the paper's op-ed pages would only publish viewpoints that support ""personal liberties and free markets.""

3. Mark Zuckerberg

Net worth: $207 billion

1-day change: up $25.8 billion

Year-to-date change: down $723 million

Warren Buffett, 94, is the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, and the only member of the top 10 list to have consistently made gains this year. He's up $8.12 billion as of Wednesday, and $20 billion so far in 2025.

Buffet's conglomerate holds multibillion-dollar stakes in public companies such as Apple and American Express. His ability to withstand market crashes has earned him a reputation as a legendary investor.

5. Larry Ellison

Net worth: $159 billion

1-day change: up $15.5 billion

Year-to-date change: down $32.7 billion

Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison gained $15.5 billion in a single day after Trump rolled back his tariff plan. Oracle

Larry Ellison, a major investor in Tesla, is also the cofounder and chief technology officer of Oracle, among the world's biggest software and cloud computing companies. His year-to-date losses of $32.7 billion were buoyed by his $15.5 billion gains on Wednesday.

Business Insider previously reported that Ellison, along with OpenAI's Sam Altman and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, is spearheading Project Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative supported by Trump.

6. Bill Gates

Net worth: $152 billion

1-day change: up $4.81 billion

Year-to-date change: down $6.64 billion

Bill Gates, the cofounder of Microsoft , stepped down from the tech company's board in 2020 and now owns only a small percentage of its shares.

He saw relatively modest gains compared to others on the top 10 list with a $4.81 billion net worth increase on Wednesday, bringing his year-to-date losses to $6.64 billion.

Gates now spends the majority of his public life promoting the Gates Foundation, a philanthropic endeavor supporting global health, education, and climate initiatives.

7. Bernard Arnault

Net worth: $148 billion

Bernard Arnault is the chairman and CEO of LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods conglomerate that owns more than 75 brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Moët & Chandon.

Arnault was the only one of the world's richest people to register further losses after Trump rolled back his tariff plan, losing $5.7 billion on Wednesday, and bringing his total year-to-date losses to $28.4 billion.

8. Larry Page

Net worth: $142 billion

Google cofounder Larry Page remains a board member and major shareholder of its parent company, Alphabet, after stepping down as Alphabet's CEO in 2019.

Page's life and finances have been overseen by wealth manager Wayne Osborne since 2012. Though he's registered $25.8 billion in losses so far this year, Wednesday's rally saw Page's net worth increase by $11 billion.

9. Steve Ballmer

Net worth: $136 billion

1-day change: up $11.2 billion

Microsoft's former CEO, Steve Ballmer, remains one of the company's largest individual shareholders with an estimated 4% stake in the tech giant. His net worth on Wednesday increased by $11.2 billion, offsetting the $10.1 billion in losses he has seen so far this year.

Ballmer also owns the Los Angeles Clippers, an NBA team Forbes values at $5.5 billion, which he purchased in 2014 for $2 billion.

10. Sergey Brin

Net worth: $134 billion

1-day change: up $10.2 billion

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Meta whistleblower: Facebook worked with Chinese government to censor posts,Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams testified Wednesday afternoon before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-whistleblower-testimony-senate-judiciary-subcommittee/,2025-04-09,"Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams told senators in testimony Wednesday on Capitol Hill that the social media company worked ""hand in glove"" with the Chinese government to censor its platforms, among other allegations.

""I saw Meta executives repeatedly undermine U.S. national security and betray American values,"" Wynn-Williams said in her opening remarks, which were obtained by CBS News before the hearing.

Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism and led the bipartisan hearing, said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ""made censorship his business model.""

""The evidence that we have in black and white is a company and leadership that is willing to do anything, anything, work with America's chief competitor, work with our chief adversary,"" Hawley said.

Hawley sent a letter to Zuckerberg Thursday requesting his testimony before the subcommittee, writing, ""The American people deserve to know the truth about your company.""

Wynn-Williams began working at Meta, then known as Facebook, as the director of Global Public Policy in 2011. In her almost seven years with the company, Wynn-Williams told the panel she witnessed the company provide ""custom built censorship tools"" for the Chinese Communist Party. She said a Chinese dissident living in the United States was removed from Facebook in 2017 after pressure from Chinese officials. Facebook said at the time it took action against the regime critic, Guo Wengui, for sharing someone else's personal information.

Wynn-Williams described the use of a ""virality counter"" that flagged posts with over 10,000 views for review by a ""chief editor,"" which Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called ""an Orwellian censor."" These ""virality counters"" were used not only in Mainland China, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan, according to Wynn-Williams's testimony.

Wynn-Williams also told senators Chinese officials could ""potentially access"" the data of American users. When Meta engineers expressed concern about data security, Wynn-Williams testified that Meta leadership, including Zuckerberg, were indifferent.

Wynn-Williams testified Zuckerberg was ""personally invested"" in Meta's business relationship with China, claiming he committed to learning Mandarin and ""had weekly Mandarin sessions with employees.""

Wynn-Williams alleged Meta's artificial intelligence model known as ""Llama"" was used to help DeepSeek. DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company that sent shockwaves through the American technology industry earlier this year when its AI model was shown to be competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.

In a statement last year on Llama, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone wrote, ""The alleged role of a single and outdated version of an American open-source model is irrelevant when we know China is already investing over 1T to surpass the US technologically, and Chinese tech companies are releasing their own open AI models as fast, or faster, than US ones.""

Wynn-Williams encouraged senators to continue investigating Meta's role in the development of artificial intelligence in China, as they continue their probe into the social media company founded by Zuckerberg.

""The greatest trick Mark Zuckerberg ever pulled was wrapping the American flag around himself and calling himself a patriot and saying he didn't offer services in China, while he spent the last decade building an $18 billion business there,"" she said.

In response to her opening statement, a Meta spokesperson called Wynn-Williams' testimony ""divorced from reality and riddled with false claims.""

""While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today,"" Meta said in a statement.

Meta, which changed its name from Facebook in 2021, operates some of the most popular social media platforms in the United States, including its previous namesake Facebook as well as Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.

Washington is taking a more aggressive posture toward China and its growing threat to American economic interests and national security. The Trump administration increased tariffs on imported goods from China to 125% Wednesday. The administration also continues to pursue the sale of TikTtok, a short-form video platform owned by Chinese company ByteDance, to an American buyer. And on Capitol Hill in 2023, the House of Representatives created the Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party to investigate China's challenge to American global power.

In March, Wynn-Williams published a memoir called ""Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed and Lost Idealism"" about her time at Meta.",0.9924,0.044,0.857,0.099

The post Meta is failing to sto…",https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2025/meta-disinformation-non-english-languages/,2025-04-09,"Fighting disinformation in today’s digital landscape is daunting, especially in linguistically diverse regions. For six years, I’ve worked across Africa, combating harmful digital narratives on platforms like those owned by Meta. While I’ve focused primarily on English-speaking nations, I’ve also tackled falsehoods in Swahili, Amharic, Oromo, Hausa and Zulu.

Meta’s automated filters and content moderators often fall short when dealing with non-English content. This isn’t just a technical limitation — it’s a dangerous oversight. In communities where English isn’t the dominant language, this gap leaves space for disinformation to flourish unchecked.

Two recent examples show the effects disinformation can have.

In Ethiopia, as tensions rise over access to Eritrea’s Port of Assab on the Red Sea, a vital strategic asset it lost following Eritrea’s secession in 1993, false Amharic-language Facebook posts claimed Ethiopian troops had seized the port. The images were digitally manipulated. But they spread widely and undermined diplomatic efforts to calm the tensions in the region.

Similarly, in Tanzania, ahead of the October general elections, a digitally manipulated video circulated on Facebook. It showed politician John Heche appearing to criticize fellow Chadema leader Freeman Mbowe. In truth, the unedited original clip captured Heche praising him.

As this kind of disinformation spreads, fact-checkers have taken dual roles — part journalist, part moderators — investigating and correcting false narratives. This is simply because major platforms like Meta and X struggle to flag or easily identify harmful content in local languages.

Since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, I’ve seen a sharp rise in falsehoods shared in African local languages. While at the wire service AFP, my team consistently raised this issue with Meta, urging the company to build tools or develop mechanisms to address the issue of flagging more harmful and toxic non-English content on the platform. For more than three years, no real progress was made. When I took a study break in August, the problem persisted.

Meta’s platforms cater to billions of users worldwide, a significant number of whom do not use English as their language of communication. Studies, including one from Harvard referenced below, have revealed that harmful content, such as misinformation, hate speech and violent or extremist material — more so in non-English languages, but also some in English — often evades moderation efforts. This challenge is especially pronounced in areas where Meta holds a dominant presence but lacks sufficient resources to address linguistic diversity.

Community Notes fall short

Meta’s replacement of professional fact-checkers with Community Notes in the U.S. raises serious concerns about its global strategy. A recent Harvard study showed that English-language posts are flagged at double the rate of their Spanish counterparts — 49% compared to 21%. That’s despite Spanish being spoken by more than 40 million Americans.

A leaked internal document from Meta posted on FBarchive.org — a repository of internal Facebook records — revealed that the tech company uses automated translations to convert non-English posts into English for moderation. The document warns that this method carries significant risks. Inaccurate translations can result in the removal of harmless posts or, conversely, permit harmful content to stay on the platform.

The risk goes beyond error. In one study, English speakers reviewing translated Mandarin content assessed it very differently from native speakers. This underscores the problem: automated translation isn’t good enough to moderate complex, context-driven speech.

FBarchive.org grants public access to leaked internal Meta documents provided by whistleblower Frances Haugen. These documents offer valuable insights into Meta’s difficulties in managing and moderating content on its platforms.

Linguistic inequity

Meta only reports statistics on content that it has removed from its platform, not what users report and it ignores. The lack of transparency is worse for non-English content, where moderation infrastructure is weak.

The issue becomes even more pronounced in non-English content due to inadequate infrastructure for language-specific moderation. While Meta claims that its hate speech detection tools can identify content in more than 100 languages, the company lacks transparency regarding the regional and language breakdown of its user base. Internal evidence shows variations in the accuracy of these detection tools, with some proving completely ineffective at identifying hate speech in languages or dialects that are not included in the programming.

The Harvard report highlights the impact of language coverage gaps in conflict regions, emphasizing how limitations in algorithmic moderation have allowed hate speech in languages like Amharic and Burmese to proliferate without adequate checks. This has contributed to real-world consequences, exacerbating tensions and challenges in countries like Ethiopia and Myanmar. Addressing these gaps is crucial for fostering safer online spaces and mitigating harm in vulnerable communities.

The findings of this study align with the on-the-ground experiences shared by fact-checkers working across multilingual settings.

Journalists across Africa have consistently sounded the alarm. For instance, Amharic — a language spoken by more than 57 million people in Ethiopia — is routinely exploited to spread harmful content related to the country’s ongoing conflicts. Similarly, Swahili, with over 150 million speakers across Africa, often serves as a vehicle for hate speech, propaganda and job scams. However, Meta’s response to these issues has been notably sluggish.

If Meta opts to replace fact-checkers with Community Notes in regions such as Africa, Latin America, Asia, or even parts of Europe where non-English languages are commonly used, the repercussions will be severe. Fact-checkers play a vital role in combating misinformation, especially in non-English-speaking areas where language-specific nuances are critical. Without targeted interventions and improved moderation strategies, such a shift could have dire consequences for regions already grappling with the harmful effects of unchecked content.

A journalist and researcher focused on disinformation in Ethiopia, whom I granted anonymity due to frequent harassment and threats targeting both him and his family, said that social media platforms in the country remain a vast hub for the spread of disinformation.

“Meta and X’s efforts to monitor and moderate harmful content in Ethiopian local languages have not been effective. Various empirical studies support this claim. Several reasons contribute to this issue, including the limited focus of content in Ethiopian local languages and the fact that major languages, such as Amharic and Afaan Oromoo, have not been adapted for machine learning techniques that could aid in monitoring harmful content. I question the expertise and capability of these platforms’ teams to address harmful content in these languages effectively,” the journalist said.

He added that this is concerning, given that Facebook in Ethiopia is viewed as “the internet” and hosts a significant amount of harmful and polarizing content.

“The Facebook tool appears to be ineffective in identifying harmful content that can be fact-checked in Amharic and Afaan Oromoo. Since I began monitoring the tool in 2021, the content flagged in these languages has primarily consisted of rumors or material that is too vague to be classified as misinformation or disinformation. Despite the widespread dissemination of harmful content on social media platforms in the country, the tool has rarely detected information related to the ongoing conflict in Ethiopia, disinformation, or other significant issues prevalent in these languages. This suggests a notable gap in the tool’s ability to effectively address content in local languages”.

Afaan Oromoo is spoken by more than 40 million people, predominantly in Ethiopia, where it serves as the native language of the Oromo ethnic group. It is also spoken by communities in northern Kenya, making it one of the most widely spoken languages in the Horn of Africa.

A fact-checker based in East Africa, who opted to remain anonymous due to her organization’s collaboration with Meta, expressed worry about the rise of divisive content posted in regional languages like Swahili, especially in Kenya and Tanzania. She pointed out a notable deficiency in content moderation for non-English languages common in the area, emphasizing how major platforms such as Meta and X often overlook or fail to identify such posts.

She shared that she has debunked multiple false claims in Swahili related to Tanzania’s upcoming elections and Kenya’s deeply divisive political climate. A recurring issue she’s identified in Tanzania involves the use of deepfakes — authentic videos digitally manipulated to include fake Swahili text.

Proactively, she regularly scours Facebook groups and X for toxic or harmful material shared in regional languages such as Swahili. When she detects misinformation, she promptly takes decisive steps to debunk it.",-0.9985,0.13,0.8,0.07

The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has initiated an inquiry into Meta Platforms, demanding over a decade of internal records, focusing on alleged efforts to collaborate with the Chinese government and develop censorship tools to enter China's restricted digital market.

The investigation is based on revelations from Sarah Wynn-Williams' book, ""Careless People,"" which details a covert project called ""Project Aldrin"" aimed at establishing a presence in China by 2017, including the development of content control mechanisms to meet Chinese demands.

Meta has denied the allegations, stating the claims are outdated and unreliable. The company has also filed for arbitration to enforce a non-disparagement agreement, resulting in a temporary gag order on Wynn-Williams, preventing her from promoting the book or making critical comments about Meta.

Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Josh Hawley have expressed deep concern over the ethical implications of Meta's alleged actions, emphasizing the potential complicity in human rights abuses and the broader issue of tech companies' ethical responsibilities in the global market.

The investigation could set a precedent for how tech companies handle similar situations, potentially leading to legal and reputational consequences for Meta. The subcommittee's findings may influence future U.S. policy on technology and human rights, emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability in the tech industry.

U.S. lawmakers have launched an investigation into Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, over allegations that the tech giant explored ways to collaborate with the Chinese government to break into the country's heavily restricted digital market.

The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations announced the inquiry on Tuesday, April 1, demanding internal records and communications dating back over a decade, including those tied to censorship mechanisms designed to comply with Beijing's demands.

The investigation, led by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-MN), with support from Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Josh Hawley (R-MO), is based on revelations published in ""Careless People,"" a memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams. The book outlines a covert initiative, internally referred to as ""Project Aldrin,"" which was reportedly developed in 2014 as a three-year plan to establish a presence in China. This plan allegedly included developing censorship tools to meet the stringent content control requirements of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). (Related: ""Project Aldrin"": Senate probes Meta's alleged censorship dealings with China.)

Johnson's subcommittee has formally requested that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg turn over the requested documents by April 21. The letter from the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, dated April 1, addresses these concerns and refers to the internal Meta materials reviewed by the subcommittee, which corroborate Wynn-Williams' account.

Meta has firmly denied the allegations, dismissing them as outdated and unreliable. A Meta spokesperson stated, ""This is all pushed by an employee terminated eight years ago for poor performance. We do not operate our services in China today. It is no secret that we were once interested in doing so as part of Facebook's effort to connect the world. We ultimately opted not to go through with the ideas we'd explored, which Mark Zuckerberg announced in 2019.""

However, the company's legal actions have further fueled the controversy. On the day ""Careless People"" was released, Meta filed for arbitration, citing a voluntary non-disparagement agreement that Wynn-Williams had signed upon her departure. Within 24 hours, an arbitrator issued a temporary gag order that barred her from making ""disparaging, critical or otherwise detrimental comments"" about Meta and from promoting the book.

Congressional concerns and legal challenges

Blumenthal expressed deep concern over the internal documents reviewed by the subcommittee.

""Chilling whistleblower documents reviewed by the Subcommittee paint a damning portrait of a company that would censor, conceal and deceive, to obtain access to the Chinese market,"" he stated. The subcommittee also investigates Meta's abandoned attempt to establish a submarine data cable connecting California and Hong Kong.

Wynn-Williams' legal team has pushed to overturn the gag order, arguing that it prevents her from responding to inquiries from members of Congress and foreign governments. Her lawyers contend that the silence enforced through arbitration is cutting off access to key testimony about corporate behavior with real-world public policy implications. Meta has claimed it does not intend to interfere with her legal rights.

The investigation into Meta's alleged collaboration with the Chinese government touches on the broader issue of tech companies' ethical responsibilities in the global market. China's internet is heavily regulated, with strict censorship laws and a firewall that blocks access to many foreign websites. Companies seeking to enter the Chinese market often face a choice between complying with these regulations and maintaining their core values.

This case also highlights the tension between corporate interests and human rights. Critics argue that by developing censorship tools, Meta would be complicit in China's human rights abuses, which include surveillance and the suppression of dissent. The investigation could have far-reaching implications for how tech companies navigate the complex political and ethical landscape of the Chinese market.

Having introduced Instagram Teen Accounts, last year, Meta has now done the same for both Facebook and Messenger.

Just as with Instagram, Teen Accounts on the social and messaging platforms have built-in protections and restrictions. At the same time, the company is also introducing additional controls and restrictions for teenage users on Instagram.

See also:

Meta says that its family of Teen Accounts has been developed with parents in mind, and it is not surprising to find that the idea has spread from Instagram to other company products. Although the rollout is underway now, it is not yet global -- which raises questions about the possibility of circumvention.

In a blog post about the new Team Account, Meta says:

Teen Accounts on Facebook and Messenger will offer similar, automatic protections to limit inappropriate content and unwanted contact, as well as ways to ensure teens’ time is well spent. We’ll begin rolling Facebook and Messenger Teen Accounts out to teens in the US, UK, Australia and Canada and will bring the experience to teens in other regions soon.

The company says that it will automatically place teens into Teen Accounts, and teens under 16 need a parent’s permission to relax any of these settings.

On the subject of new protections that are on their way to Instagram Teen Accounts in the coming weeks, Meta says:

We know parents are worried about strangers contacting their teens -- or teens receiving unwanted contact. In addition to the existing built-in protections offered by Teen Accounts, we’re adding new restrictions for Instagram Live and unwanted images in DMs. With these changes, teens under 16 will be prohibited from going Live unless their parents give them permission to do so. We’ll also require teens under 16 to get parental permission to turn off our feature that blurs images containing suspected nudity in DMs.

Although we also know about the restrictions that an Instagram Teen Account is subject to, Meta has not been, as yet, very clear about how this translates onto Messenger and Facebook.",0.5391,0.031,0.932,0.038
"META Platforms, Facebook.",A Former Facebook Executive Got a Gag Order After Her Tell-All Published. She’s Talking to Congress Anyway.,"After Meta tried to enforce a non-disparagement agreement with Sarah Wynn-Williams, her memoir, Careless People, became a bestseller.",https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/sarah-wynn-williams-testimony,2025-04-09,"A former Facebook executive who recently published an explosive tell-all memoir about her time at the company is set to testify before Congress Wednesday about the risk she claims Meta poses to US national security.

Sarah Wynn-Williams, Facebook’s former director of global public policy, sent Meta’s sizable public relations and legal apparatus into overdrive in March when her book debuted, alleging that she had been terminated from the company after accusing its now chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan of sexual harassment. Among other things, the book also charged the company with cozying up to China’s censorship regime in hopes of launching its services there—a topic that Wynn-Williams plans to focus on in her testimony, according to her prepared remarks, which were first reported on by NBC News.

Meta previously told Vanity Fair that the book included a “mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives.” A slew of former employees have also since spoken out, testifying to Kaplan’s character and accusing Wynn-Williams of misrepresenting events.

Meta went so far as to seek an emergency hearing with an arbitrator to enforce a non-disparagement agreement Wynn-Williams signed in exchange for severance when she was fired in 2017. The arbitrator barred Wynn-Williams from promoting the book or “amplifying or repeating” any “disparaging, critical or otherwise detrimental comments.”

But the Streisand Effect is a heckuva thing, and Careless People not only soared to the top of Amazon’s bestseller list, but it also caught the attention of Big Tech hawks like Republican Senator Josh Hawley, who chairs the Senate subcommittee that Wynn-Williams will brief Wednesday.

In her opening remarks, Wynn-Williams plans to accuse Meta of working “‘hand in glove’ with the Chinese Communist Party to construct and test custom-built censorship tools that silenced and censored their critics.” She also plans to accuse Meta of lying about its operations in China, including about its open-source AI model Llama.

Reuters reported last year that Meta’s Llama has been used by researchers linked to China’s People’s Liberation Army, a use case Meta’s director of public policy told Reuters was “unauthorized and contrary to our acceptable use policy.” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone stated on X that “the alleged role of a single and outdated version of an American open-source model is irrelevant when we know China is already investing over [$1 trillion] to surpass the US technologically.”

In her remarks, Wynn-Williams notes that advertisers in China remain a significant revenue stream for Meta. Indeed, the company brought in $18 billion from Chinese advertisers last year, according to its SEC reports. However, Meta argues that ad revenue is distinct from operating its platforms for users to join in China. “Sarah Wynn-Williams’ testimony is divorced from reality and riddled with false claims,” Meta spokesperson Ryan Daniels told Vanity Fair. “While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today.”

Wynn-Williams plans to acknowledge the arbitrator’s order that she refrain from badmouthing Meta. But, in her remarks, she writes that she is speaking to Congress “at considerable personal risk because you have the power and the authority to hold them accountable.”

Meta has said the arbitrator’s order does not prohibit Wynn-Williams’ testimony. “We have no intention to interfere with Wynn-Williams’ legal rights,” Daniels said.ecurity.

Sarah Wynn-Williams, Facebook’s former director of global public policy, sent Meta’s sizable public relations and legal apparatus into overdrive in March when her book debuted, alleging that she had been terminated from the company after accusing its now chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan of sexual harassment. Among other things, the book also charged the company with cozying up to China’s censorship regime in hopes of launching its services there — a topic that Wynn-Williams plans to focus on in her testimony, according to her prepared remarks, which were first reported by NBC News.",-0.6017,0.071,0.865,0.064

What the stats tell us Short-form video is winning everywhere

Across platforms, short-form video is the way to go for memorable and engaging content. With nearly 139 million Instagram Reels watched every minute and TikTok turning almost half its users into buyers, short videos aren’t just popular—they’re powerful. Influencer marketing is taking the lead

In 2025, brands are expected to spend more on influencer marketing than on digital ads — a big sign of shifting trust and impact. TikTok and Pinterest are especially strong here, with younger users more likely to shop based on recommendations. Start identifying and building relationships with influencers now (particularly those with engaged audiences in the 18-34 demographic) to lock in high-performing campaigns for 2025. X and LinkedIn are heating up

People are talking more on X and LinkedIn. Comments are way up, and posts are getting more eyes than before. That means more chances for your brand to join the conversation. Try sharing posts that invite replies—like questions, takes on news, or helpful tips. And don’t underestimate the power of a good comment: mid-length ones tend to get the most engagement. It’s a great time to show up and speak up.

How to use social media stats to inform your strategy

1. Update your social media marketing strategy

Social media statistics don’t automatically mean you should shift your entire strategy, but take what you’ve learned here and apply what makes sense for your organization’s goals.

2. Plan content specifically for each platform

You don’t need to be on every platform to reach your social media marketing goals. But for each one you are on, understand why and how people use it. Align your content with what people expect to see there.

For example, maybe videos perform best for you on Instagram and long text posts perform best on LinkedIn. Plan accordingly. (Psst: Here’s a free social media calendar template to help with that!)

3. Experiment

JK on the planning. Post at 3 A.M., never reply, go feral…

In reality, try to strike a healthy balance between strategic content aligned with your business goals and experimenting with new topics and formats to see what performs best.

4. Track your performance (and take action)

Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead

After years of lamenting the decimation of Facebook referral traffic, some publishers are starting to see that traffic return this year.

It’s nothing like the heyday of Facebook referral traffic in the late 2010s. But this new wave of growth is noteworthy, according to five publishing executives.

Facebook referral traffic quadrupled in March 2025 compared to March 2024, according to Josh Awtry, svp of audience development at Newsweek. He declined to share raw monthly visitor figures. (Newsweek’s referrals from all social platforms are up almost 10 times compared to the average day in March last year, Awtry noted.)

Political news site The Hill had 48 million visits in February, with month-over-month growth up 17%, making it the fastest growing English-language news site for visits, according to the Press Gazette. A big part of that is attributable to a surge in social referral traffic in February and March, said Sarakshi Rai, The Hill’s director of audience development. Facebook referrals in particular have tripled since last year for the publisher, she noted.

“That has really changed for us,” Rai said. “Social coming back up for us is huge.” (She’s not alone in saying that social referral traffic is having a moment.) Facebook is now starting to “tick up again” to make up about 50% of The Hill’s social referral traffic, she added.

“There’s been a surge in stories being picked up on Facebook again,” Rai told Digiday.

News publisher Salon has seen a 148% increase in page views in the last three months compared to the three months prior, according to Salon’s general manager Amanda Wolfe. “We’re seeing a large corresponding increase in impressions and engagement on Facebook itself,” she said.

Facebook revenue and referral traffic are up about 30% from their lowest point last November, one publishing exec said during a closed-door town hall session during the Digiday Publishing Summit in Vail, Colorado, in March.

But none of the execs interviewed for this story are hanging their hats on the return of Facebook referrals.

Publishers have a history of being burned by Facebook parent Meta. The platform shut down its Facebook News tab last year, removed Instant Articles in 2023 and de-prioritized content shared by publishers in 2018. These moves have destabilized a lot of audience strategies for publishers over the years, with many still dealing with that challenge through 2023 and 2024.

“It’s still drastically different than it was two years ago, and certainly different than it was six years ago,” the anonymous publishing exec said during the town hall.

It’s important to note that The Hill, Newsweek and Salon are all news outlets, and the fact that they cover politics could be evidence of a “Trump bump,” or a renewed interest in news following the presidential election.

“I think there’s always interest every time there’s a new president or new administration,” Rai said. “I think also for news fatigue post-election, now some of that has come back.”

The top stories driving people from Facebook to Newsweek’s site are political and economic coverage, Awtry said. At the beginning of this year, Meta said it would bring posts about elections, politics and social issues back into its social feeds after reducing their visibility in 2021.

“Even a few months ago, any hard news was a non-starter on Facebook,” Awtry said. “No clickthroughs, virtually no engagement. But we’ve been sharing a lot more of our hard news content post-inauguration and algorithm change, and reader interest in it has eclipsed the lifestyle coverage that has dominated for the past couple of years.”

But the increase in Facebook referral traffic that these publishers are experiencing is not something that’s happening across the board.

Chartbeat data of 3,800 sites shows that the number of raw page views has increased slightly, but not enough to show a real trend. Meanwhile, Similarweb data of desktop traffic shows Facebook referrals to the top 100 news and media sites were up 9.6% year over year in February (but down 4.75% YoY in January). Traffic was up 4.45% month over month in January and 2.19% in February.

Those who are seeing an uptick said they haven’t done anything differently on Facebook that would have warranted this initial this surge in referral traffic and engagement on the platform, leading them to believe it’s a change at the platform level.

“We haven’t done anything different,” Rai said. “We’ve stuck to doing what we’ve always done.”

Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story.

Newsweek has put more resources into Facebook since the start of this year, after seeing the increase in referral traffic from the platform.

But it’s not like publishers have gotten a lot of guidance from Meta, either.

“We don’t have conversations with anybody about [publisher programs]. All of a sudden [this uptick] just shows up,” the anonymous publishing exec said.

What’s more, a new Friends tab could end up throwing this all for a loop. When Digiday asked two execs what impact that new tab — which only shows posts from friends and family — could have on their referral traffic, their answer boiled down to: we have no idea.",0.9955,0.024,0.893,0.084

Despite Zuckerberg’s multiple olive branches to the Turmp administration, a number of high-profile, pro-MAGA voices are still banned on Meta’s Facebook and Instagram platforms.

The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Mark Zuckerberg has made regular visits to the White House urging the president to lean on the FTC to drop its case against Meta. If the FTC were to prevail in the case, Meta could be forced to divest from WhatsApp and Instagram, breaking up the company.

In January, Zuckerberg made several public overtures to the Trump administration, praising parts of its policy platform in an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience, and criticizing the outgoing Biden administration for its censorship demands during COVID. Zuckerberg also announced a policy pivot at Meta, promising to “get back to our roots” of supporting free speech.

Despite these pledges, several prominent anti-establishment figures remain banned on Meta platforms:

Laura Loomer, investigative journalist and former Republican congressional candidate who was recently credited with influencing a shakeup at the NSC.

Tommy Robinson, the prominent British political activist and critic of Islam.

Alex Jones

Paul Joseph Watson

Gavin McInnes

Milo Yiannopoulos, self-styled “civil rights icon” and former Breitbart News editor.

It is also unclear if Meta still maintains its “hate agents” list of prominent anti-establishment voices uncovered by Breitbart News in 2019 that included political candidates. Or if the company has taken any steps to remedy the mass-censorship of WhatsApp accounts in Brazil, which extended to Flavio Bolsonaro, son of persecuted former president Jair Bolsonaro. In a comment to Breitbart News, the company denied it has continued to maintain its documented list of hate agents.

As the FTC trial date draws closer, Meta has drawn flak from the conservative commentariat.

“Zuckerberg is full of shit,” said Laura Loomer in an X post yesterday. “And so are all of the so called “conservatives” he brought on now that Trump is back. Facebook lied to me & said my account would be restored. I’m still banned.”

“Zuckerberg spent hundreds of millions — billions — of dollars supporting open borders, “criminal justice reform” (think – George Floyd riots) and election-fixing for Democrats and now he wants favors from the Trump administration,” said War Room reporter Natalie Winters, quoting from an article on Zuckerberg and the “tech right.”

The article quoted by Winters was written by the X account Captive Dreamer, whose video criticizing Zuckerberg and Meta has racked up over a million views.

“Facebook must be broken up,” said author and filmmaker Mike Cernovich. “[Instagram] and WhatsApp should not have been allowed to merge with them. Clear antitrust violations, this limits competition and gives too much power to censor to one man, Mark Zuckerberg, who hates America.”

Meta spokesperson Francis Brennan told Breitbart News in a statement that it currently has no list of “hate agents” and “given our recent policy changes, we are exploring the possibility of restoring certain accounts.”

As Zuckerberg and other Meta executives work to get closer to the Trump Administration, Breitbart News will continue to investigate the platforms treatment of conservative figures.

The system involves putting younger teens on the platforms into more restricted settings by default, with parental permission required in order to live stream or turn off image protections for messages. It was first introduced last September on Instagram, which Meta says ""fundamentally changed the experience for teens"" on the platform. But campaigners say it's unclear what difference Teen Accounts has actually made.

""Eight months after Meta rolled out Teen Accounts on Instagram, we've had silence from Mark Zuckerberg about whether this has actually been effective and even what sensitive content it actually tackles,"" said Andy Burrows, chief executive of the Molly Rose Foundation. He added it was ""appalling"" that parents still did not know whether the settings prevented their children being ""algorithmically recommended"" inappropriate or harmful content. Matthew Sowemimo, associate head of policy for child safety online at the NSPCC, said Meta's changes ""must be combined with proactive measures so dangerous content doesn't proliferate on Instagram, Facebook and Messenger in the first place"". But Drew Benvie, chief executive of social media consultancy Battenhall, said it was a step in the right direction. ""For once, big social are fighting for the leadership position not for the most highly engaged teen user base, but for the safest,"" he said. However he also pointed out there was a risk, as with all platforms, that teens could ""find a way around safety settings."" The expanded roll-out of Teen Accounts is beginning in the UK, US, Australia and Canada from Tuesday. Companies that provide services popular with children have faced pressure to introduce parental controls or safety mechanisms to safeguard their experiences. In the UK, they also face legal requirements to prevent children from encountering harmful and illegal content on their platforms, under the Online Safety Act. What the Online Safety Act is - and how to keep your child safe online Roblox recently enabled parents to block specific games or experiences on the hugely popular platform as part of its suite of controls.

What are Teen Accounts?

How Teen Accounts work depend on the self-declared age of the user. Those aged 16 to 18 will be able to toggle off default safety settings like having their account set to private. But 13 to 15 year olds must obtain parental permission to turn off such settings - which can only be done by adding a parent or guardian to their account. Meta says it has moved at least 54 million teens globally into teen accounts since they were introduced in September. It says that 97% of 13 to 15 year olds have also kept its built-in restrictions. The system relies on users being truthful about their age when they set up accounts - with Meta using methods such as video selfies to verify their information. It said in 2024 it would begin using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify teens who might be lying about their age in order to place them back into Teen Accounts. Findings published by the UK media regulator Ofcom in November 2024 suggested that 22% of eight to 17 year olds lie that they are 18 or over on social media apps. Some teenagers told the BBC it was still ""so easy"" to lie about their age on platforms.

The company revealed plans to go down a similar route to X and use Community Notes to allows for crowd-sourced fact-checking instead.

After a short period of testing -- less than a month, in fact -- Community Notes are now starting to appear on Facebook, Instagram and Threads. Meta has also confirmed that, with immediate effect, there will be no new fact check labels on content in many parts of the world.

See also:

Rather than making a big announcement about the launch of Community Notes, Meta has instead opted to update an old blog post with the news. The newly added text states: “Starting today, we’re ending our third-party fact checking program in the United States, and Community Notes will start to appear on Facebook, Instagram and Threads”.

Meta goes on to say:

This means that we will no longer show new fact check labels on content in the United States. Instead notes, written and rated by the growing community of contributors, will be published gradually as we continue to test our algorithm and internal systems in the coming weeks and months.

Outlining how the new system works, Meta makes no secret of the fact that X’s approach was a big inspiration for its own platforms: “Many of you will be familiar with X’s Community Notes system, in which users add context to posts. That’s the broad approach we are adopting”.

The company provides further details about how Community Notes work:

Meta won’t decide what gets rated or written -- contributors from our community will. And to safeguard against bias, notes won’t be published unless contributors with a range of viewpoints broadly agree on them.

This isn’t majority rules. No matter how many contributors agree on a note, it won’t be published unless people who normally disagree decide that it provides helpful context.

Community Notes will have a limit of 500 characters and will need to include a link to support the note.

To start with, notes won’t have author names attached to them. We want notes to be rated based on whether the context they add is helpful, not on who wrote them.

Contributors need to be over 18, have an account that’s more than 6 months old and in good standing, and either have a verified phone number or be enrolled in two-factor authentication.

The Community Notes feature will be available in 6 languages commonly used in the United States to start, including: English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French and Portuguese, and we will expand to other languages with time.

To start with, contributors will not be able to submit notes on advertisements. They can, however, write and submit notes on almost any other forms of content, including posts by Meta, our executives, politicians and other public figures.

Meta claims that “we expect Community Notes to be less biased than the third party fact checking program it replaces”. Time will tell whether this is the case or not, but it is unlikely to be something that will be viewed through an objective lens.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Inside the Facebook Algorithm in 2025: All the Updates You Need to Know,Is there a secret to getting your content seen by as many people as possible? Here’s everything we know about how the Facebook algorithm works and how you can get your content the reach it deserves.,https://buffer.com/resources/facebook-algorithm/,2025-04-08,"Remember good old chronological news feeds? Back in the early days of Facebook, circa 2006 or so, posts were shown pretty much in order of recency when you opened up the social media platform.

Well, things look a bit different nearly twenty years later.

What started as a place for sharing updates and photos with friends and family — putting the ‘social’ in social media — has grown into a full-fledged content platform.

Facebook has evolved from personal profiles to a space where people can follow creators and brands, join communities and groups, and promote events. Instead of just text and photo posts, there are now disappearing stories, reels, live streams, and much more.

With so many new features available on the platform, it makes sense that the Facebook algorithm — the ranking system that uses machine learning to arrange content in users’ feeds — has changed too.

What used to be one chronological feed is now a set of different feeds — and multiple feeds means multiple algorithms. These algorithms work together to decide what content users see when they open the app.

The Facebook algorithm is the lifeblood of one of the original social networks. It’s what makes the platform so more-ish — so it’s no surprise that it's developed an almost mythical status for brands and creators. Is there a secret to getting your content seen by as many people as possible?

Understanding how the Facebook algorithms work is a solid start. When you know what Facebook looks for when showing posts to users, you can make more thoughtful decisions about what, when, and why you post.

In this article, I’ll unpack everything we know about how the Facebook algorithms work, and I’ll share some tips you can use to get your content the reach it deserves.

How the Facebook algorithm works in 2025

The Facebook algorithm was created so that the Meta-owned platform shows users more interesting, relevant content that’s tailored to them and keeps them scrolling longer.

“Facebook’s goal is to make sure that you see posts from the people, interests, and ideas that you find valuable, whether that content comes from people you’re already connected to or from those you may not yet know,” the company says .

To that end, there are three different types of content that will make it into users’ feeds:

Connected content — content from the people they're friends with or are following, groups they've joined, and pages they've liked. Recommended content — content Facebook thinks they’ll be interested in from pages and people they don't already follow. Ads — content people see because of targeting, rather than the algorithm.

Since this post is about the Facebook algorithm and not Facebook ads , I'll unpack the first two here.

How the Facebook algorithm ranks connected content

If a user is your friend (for personal profiles) or likes your Facebook Page or profile (for businesses and creators), your content may show up in their home feed when they open the app as part of the connected content system.

Here’s how Facebook evaluates and ranks your content:

1. Checks what posts are available

In the first part of this process, the algorithm looks at all the content that could show up in a user’s feed. This includes content shared by their friends, the pages they follow, and the groups they’ve joined.

Right from the get-go, content that violates Facebook’s Community Standards is excluded (more on this below).

2. Looks at signals

The second thing the Facebook algorithm does is look at ranking factors called ‘signals’ to decide how relevant a piece of content will be to that particular user. There are thousands of possible signals Facebook considers that are based on both user behavior and the post itself. Here are some examples.

The Facebook feed algorithm might look at how often someone’s seen similar types of content recently (like photos or videos) and how much time they’re spending on their feed. It also takes into account factors related to the post, like how many comments or reactions it has and how long the comments are, on average.

Importantly, it also looks at how likely someone is to interact with the person who shared the post, especially if they’re friends or in a group. That prediction is based on things like past interactions between them, both in public (like comments of reactions) and in DMs.

The Facebook stories algorithm might look at how often someone views stories in general and how many stories (or sets of stories) they’ve watched from different people or pages. It also pays attention to whether they’ve missed any stories from a person or page they follow, how many photos or videos are in a story set, and if they’ve ever replied to that person or page’s stories with a message.

3. Making predictions

Each of those thousands of signals is then used to make “personalized predictions about which content [users will] find most relevant and valuable.”

In other words, the algorithm looks at users’ past behavior to make predictions about whether they’ll be interested in your post and likely to interact with it.

For example, if you run a brand Facebook Page that they follow and visit often, and they regularly share your posts, Facebook knows they’re a fan. They probably want to see more of your content in their feed.

A less obvious example: If a user likes shopping in the afternoons and reacts to more branded posts during that time, Facebook will use that as an indicator to surface more branded posts during that time.

💡 Facebook ranking isn’t a one-and-done situation. The ranking system is constantly evolving based on the behavior of users.

4. Scoring the content

After all that, the algorithm gives each piece of content a ‘relevance score’. The higher the relevance score, the higher in the feed it will surface.

At this point, the algorithm also mixes up the content to keep things feeling fresh — for example, it spaces out posts from the same creator or page so that users’ feeds aren’t filled with back-to-back content from one account (no matter how big a fan they may be).

Once all the connected content has been logged, analyzed, and ranked, the algorithm then starts to throw recommended content into the mix.

How the Facebook algorithm ranks ‘unconnected content’ for recommendations

Facebook's recommended content system gives brands and creators a chance to draw in new fans and followers without any ad spend. It helps people in your target audience — even those who don’t follow you yet — discover the public content you share to your creator profile, brand page, group, or event.

Just like the connected content in the feed, recommendations are personalized — no two Facebook users will see exactly the same thing.

Facebook uses the same four-step ranking process for recommended content as it does for connected content, but with a different, equally large set of signals.

The feed recommendations algorithm might look at the type of post (like photo or video), how long someone watched it on their phone, and whether they’ve tapped ‘Show more’ on similar posts in the past six months. It also considers how often they’ve liked posts about a certain topic in the past 30 days, and whether they’ve shared posts from that person or page before.

The Facebook reels algorithm might look at how many reels someone has watched from a specific creator or page, which ones they’ve clicked to view in full screen, and which ones they’ve watched all the way through. It also considers factors like the video’s length, what topic the reel is tagged with, and whether the user has liked reels on a similar topic before.

Facebook has also shared detailed guidance on where it draws the line when it comes to recommendations, and certain types of content may be excluded. Since recommended posts are shown to people who may not already follow you, it makes sense that Facebook applies some pretty strict filters to keep that experience safe, relevant, and respectful.

To increase your chances of getting your content recommended to new users, it’s worth familiarizing yourself with — and sticking to — their rules.

Facebook applies two sets of standards here.

The first is its Community Standards , which are baseline rules for what’s allowed on the platform. Content that violates these rules is removed entirely.

You’ll find the full list in Facebook’s Transparency Center (which is a must-read for all marketers and creators), but here are a few common examples of content that violates these standards (and will be removed):

Still, if your content doesn’t overtly violate one of these rules, that doesn’t mean it’s eligible for recommendation.

Facebook has a second layer of standards: the Recommendations Guidelines . These apply to content that is allowed on the platform but doesn’t meet the higher bar for being recommended to Facebook users who don’t already follow you. In other words, the post might stay up, but it won’t get shown to a wider audience through feeds or suggestions.

Five categories of content are technically allowed on Facebook but may not be eligible for recommendations:

Content that makes it harder for Facebook to maintain a safe community — for example, posts that talk about self-harm, suicide, or eating disorders; are sexually explicit; or promote regulated products. Sensitive or low-quality content about health or finance — like exaggerated health claims (such as “miracle cures”), cosmetic procedure promotions, or business models that may be misleading or deceptive, such as payday loans or “risk-free” investments. Content that users generally dislike — including things like clickbait, engagement bait (such as “like this if you agree”), or overly promotional contests or giveaways. Content from sources that lack transparency — such as news content without clear authorship or publishing information. False or misleading content — including fake news or claims that have been debunked by independent fact-checkers, such as widely disproved health or vaccine-related misinformation .

9 best practices for creating successful Facebook content

There's no surefire way to ‘beat’ the Facebook algorithm, but there are plenty of things you can do to increase your chances of success on the platform. Here's our list of best practices for generating reach and engagement on Facebook.

1. Stick to a consistent posting schedule

There’s a reason this advice has stuck around: posting regularly to your social media platforms continues to be one of the best ways to grow your audience. Even Head of Facebook Tom Alison has called this out as a tip for creators looking for success on Facebook: “Posting more can help you break through,” he said in one video.

Consistency helps people stay familiar with your content, gives them more chances to engage with it, and makes it easier for Facebook to understand what kind of posts you’re sharing.

The numbers back this up too. Buffer’s analysis of data from more than 100,000 social media users found that people who posted consistently received five times more engagement per post compared to inconsistent posters. Even a moderately consistent rhythm saw four times more engagement than inconsistency.

You don’t have to post multiple times (or even once) a day to be consistent. What matters is finding a rhythm that works for you — and sticking to it — so that your audience knows when to expect something from you.

2. Create content that people want to engage with

As with all social platforms, producing high-quality content that resonates with your audience should always be your first social media marketing goal .

Posts that feel thoughtful, genuine, and relevant are far more likely to get people to pause, react, or share — and every interaction sends a signal to the algorithm that users want to see more of it.

Facebook puts it simply: before you hit publish, ask yourself, “Would people share my story with their friends or recommend it to others?” That one question can help you stay focused on creating content that feels meaningful to your target audience.

There's no cheat sheet for what that looks like — every audience is different, after all — but let the metrics guide you here. When posts don’t perform as well as you hoped,, try to get to the root of why by analyzing the info available in Facebook Insights .

Facebook Page Insights are now housed in your Page Dashboard, which you can find by clicking on your profile photo in the top right.

From your dashboard, you’ll find a high-level overview of your content performance. Click on See more insights on the top right for more.

To go deeper still, click the Go to Meta Business Suite button.

This will take you to a page like the one below, where you’ll also get a look at your Instagram content analytics if you have a connected profile.

To go directly to Meta Business Suite Insights, click on your profile photo from the Facebook home page, then hit the Meta Business Suite button.

When it comes to content that resonates, users value accurate, authentic content, Facebook says . “We work hard to understand what type of posts people consider genuine so we can rank them higher in the feed. We work to understand what kinds of content people find misleading or sensational, and work to make sure that people see those less.”

Between text-based posts, photos, GIFs, carousels, reels, and live videos, there are plenty of content types you can choose from. Mix them up to find what strikes a chord with your audience so you can learn what they want to see more of.

3. Treat engagement like a two-way conversation

Have I mentioned how much the Facebook algorithm loves engagement? While posting great content is important, what happens after that matters just as much for generating engagement.

This can be as simple as replying to messages and leaving thoughtful responses or reacting to comments. Whether you’re an influencer , creator, or brand, these small actions show you’re present — and that’s something the algorithm notices.

Engaging with your target audience should be baked into your marketing strategy, and Facebook suggests replying to comments and messages within 24 hours. That sends a signal that you’re actively engaged with your audience, and not just posting and ghosting.

This approach will create a ripple effect: the more deeply connected your followers feel to your brand (business or personal), the more likely they are to like, comment on, or share your new content.

4. Share posts that work on Facebook

According to a 2024 report from Meta , nearly 98% of the posts users viewed — whether from accounts they followed or not — didn’t include a link. In other words, most of what appears in people’s feeds is content they can view without leaving the platform.

That includes reels, photos, carousels, and text-based posts that share key information in the post itself — like the vast majority of content that people are seeing when they open the app.

Links aren’t off-limits, but they’re better used selectively. If you do include one in a post, avoid linking to what Facebook considers “ low-quality web experiences ,” such as pages with a poor mobile experience and a high ratio of ads to content or sites that ask for unnecessary personal data.

Facebook deprioritizes posts with these kinds of links, which can make them less likely to appear on people’s feeds.

5. Embrace video content

Short-form video content — especially reels — continues to be one of the fastest ways to grow on Facebook, according to Tom Alison. Reels that are under 90 seconds long can show up in more places across the app, including the video tab, the reels section on the home feed, and the “Creators to Follow” section.

Facebook has also made it clear that originality matters, and reels and videos that you film or create tend to get wider distribution than reposted reels.

That doesn’t mean you need a full production setup or documentary-quality video to get noticed. Simple, original video content still gets noticed.

Plus, Facebook videos have a bit of an edge on the platform as they have a separate feed for users (right next to ‘Home’ in the app) consisting almost entirely of recommended content.

Here’s our everything-and-the-kitchen-sink guide to Facebook Reels to get you started.

Facebook’s ‘Video’ Feed — formerly ‘Watch’ — gets special attention in the app.

Another bonus point in short-form video content’s favor: it can be cross-posted to Instagram Reels or even repurposed for YouTube Shorts and TikTok .

You can also go live on Facebook to connect with people in real-time. Live video is a chance to answer questions, share updates, host interviews, or take your audience behind the scenes of business or creator journey.

You’ll need to meet a couple of requirements first: your account must be at least 60 days old and have 100 followers before you can start a live session.

Once the live video ends, you have 30 days to download a copy before Facebook deletes it. From there, you can repurpose the best moments into shorter clips for reels (or video on other social media platforms) to keep reaching people after the live broadcast is over.

6. Post user-generated content

When people tag you in posts, take notice: this is a perfect opportunity to share that post as UGC (or user-generated content) — with their permission, of course. UGC helps show followers real experiences with your brand, while also giving the original poster a little recognition in return.

Reviews are another great source of content. If someone’s left a thoughtful review of your business on sites like TrustPilot or Yelp, you can turn it into a short Facebook post and tag the person in a caption. It’s a simple way to show social proof — and it might even bring in a new follower (if the reviewer wasn't following you to begin with).

7. Publish posts that create meaningful conversations

Posts that spark meaningful interactions are more likely to get noticed, not just by your audience but by the Facebook algorithm too. Facebook likes authentic accounts that contribute to their community and help start or sustain thoughtful conversations.

That doesn’t mean every post needs to be deep or discussion-heavy. It simply means thinking beyond one-way updates or promotions. Facebook’s goal is to “bring people closer together and build relationships,” so posting overly promotional content that doesn't get comments or shares won't help your ranking. Instead of talking at your audience, aim to talk with them — ask questions, share ideas people can respond to, or invite your followers to weigh in on something.

Interacting with other people’s posts helps too. Joining relevant conversations shows you’re there to engage and be part of the community instead of simply broadcasting.

8. Don’t use clickbait and engagement bait

Facebook regularly updates its algorithm to pinpoint posts that fall into the clickbait and spammy links category.

Clickbait is content that is exaggerated, over-sensationalized, and borderline spam. It promises a result but doesn't deliver — think headlines like “The one fruit you need to stay young”, which is an obvious tactic because this magical fruit doesn’t exist.

Some clickbait links can cross the line into fake news, especially when they make claims that are both exaggerated and untrue. Fake news has been rampant on Facebook , so they've been doubling down on looking for signals that indicate misinformation or misdirection since 2018 .

Posting fake news for whatever purpose — creating false urgency, fostering fear — is against Facebook’s Community Standards , and repeated offenses can get you banned from the platform.

Not all clickbait is false. A post might use a sensationalist headline to grab attention without spreading misinformation — like “You’ll never guess what happened to this man out walking his dog,” even if the story ends up being true but underwhelming. Still, it goes against Facebook’s recommendations guidelines, and the Facebook algorithm will demote these in the feed.

Engagement bait, on the other hand, uses captions or photos that contain phrases like, “Like this if you like dogs better, share this if you like cats better.” It’s mostly harmless, but it doesn’t create any meaningful interactions — and it often feels spammy. This also goes against the recommendations guidelines, and the Facebook algorithm will demote these posts too.

9. Don’t violate Facebook’s Community Standards

We've talked about this, but it bears repeating. Facebook takes its Community Standards very seriously. The algorithm is pretty good at weeding out posts that violate these rules, but even if a post manages to skirt under the radar, Facebook users can report it and have it taken down anyway.

If your posts get removed or reported repeatedly, the overall “score” of your profile will also go down, which will lessen the visibility of your posts. In some cases, Facebook can also remove you from the platform entirely.

Don't try to game the Facebook algorithm — work with it

There you have it: there’s no shortcut to Facebook success. Yes, it’s a long game. But high-quality, engagement-driving content that doesn’t violate any guidelines is the best way to play it. You’ll be watching those follower numbers climb in no time.",0.9999,0.033,0.831,0.136

Facebook and Facebook Messenger are the next apps to get Teen Account support, with similar restrictions for users.

Teen Accounts are Meta’s answer to curating what younger audiences see on major social platforms. The accounts are built for teens under the age of 16 and utilize permissions from a parent account that can fine-tune what the teen account sees in-app.

There are a few elements that Meta has implemented to adjust the account, including who can contact the users and what content they see while browsing. The restrictions also mean accounts are private, and new followers need to request access. Those who are connected via Facebook or Instagram can send DMs, but no one else. Those DMs are also now automatically censored if certain content is detected.

Meta notes that Teen Accounts are now expanding to Facebook and Facebook Messenger. Overall, the protections won’t vary much between platforms, and contact with users under 16 will still be monitored and controlled by permissions only parents can change.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Meta accused of Llama 4 bait-and-switch to juice AI benchmark rank,"Did Facebook giant rizz up LLM to win over human voters? It appears so
Meta submitted a specially crafted, non-public variant of its Llama 4 AI model to an online benchmark that may have unfairly boosted its leaderboard position over rivals.…",https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/08/meta_llama4_cheating/,2025-04-08,"Meta submitted a specially crafted, non-public variant of its Llama 4 AI model to an online benchmark that may have unfairly boosted its leaderboard position over rivals.

The LLM was uploaded to LMArena, a popular site that pits models against each other. It's admittedly more a popularity contest than a benchmark, as you can select two submitted models to compete head-to-head, give the pair an input prompt to each answer, and vote on the best output. Thousands of these votes are collected and used to draw up a leaderboard of crowd-sourced LLM performance.

According to LMArena on Monday, Meta provided a version of Llama 4 that is not publicly available and was seemingly specifically designed to charm those human voters, potentially giving it an edge in the rankings over publicly available competitors. And we wonder where artificially intelligent systems get their Machiavellian streak from.

""Early analysis shows style and model response tone was an important factor — demonstrated in style control ranking — and we are conducting a deeper analysis to understand more,"" the chatbot ranking platform said Monday evening.

Meta should have made it clearer that Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental was a customized model to optimize for human preference

""Meta should have made it clearer that Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental was a customized model to optimize for human preference,"" the group added.

Dropped on the world in a rather unusual Saturday launch, Meta's now publicly available Llama 4 model codenamed Maverick was heralded for its LMArena performance. A ""experimental"" build of the model sat at number two in the chatbot leaderboard, just behind Google's Gemini-2.5-Pro-Exp-03-25 release.

To back up its claims that the version of the model submitted for testing was a special custom job, LMArena published a full breakdown. ""To ensure full transparency, we're releasing 2,000-plus head-to-head battle results for public review. This includes user prompts, model responses, and user preferences,"" the team said.

From the results published by LMArena to Hugging Face, the ""experimental"" version of Llama 4 Maverick, the one that went head to head against rivals in the arena, appeared to produce verbose results often peppered with emojis. The public version, the one you'd deploy in applications, produced far more concise responses that were generally devoid of emojis.

It's important for Meta to provide publicly available versions of its models for the contest so that when people come to pick and use LLMs in applications, they get the neural network they were expecting and others had rated. In this case, it appears the ""experimental"" version for the contest differed from the official release.

Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental is a chat optimized version we experimented with that also performs well on LMArena

The Facebook giant did not deny any of this.

""We experiment with all types of custom variants,"" a Meta spokesperson told El Reg.

""Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental is a chat optimized version we experimented with that also performs well on LMArena. We have now released our open source version and will see how developers customize Llama 4 for their own use cases. We're excited to see what they will build and look forward to their ongoing feedback.""

Meta for its part wasn't hiding the fact this was an experimental build. In its launch blog post, the Instagram parent wrote that ""Llama 4 Maverick offers a best-in-class performance to cost ratio with an experimental chat version scoring ELO of 1417 on LMArena.""

However, many assumed the experimental model was a beta-style preview, substantially similar to the version released to model hubs like Hugging Face on Saturday.

Suspicions were raised after excited netizens began getting their hands on the official model only to be met with lackluster results. The disconnect between Meta's benchmark claims and public perception was big enough that Meta GenAI head Ahmad Al-Dahle weighed in on Monday, pointing to inconsistent performance across inference platforms that, he said, still needed time to be properly tuned.

""We're already hearing lots of great results people are getting with these models. That said, we're also hearing some reports of mixed quality across different services. Since we dropped the models as soon as they were ready, we expect it'll take several days for all the public implementations to get dialed in,"" Al-Dahle said.

These kinds of issues are known to crop up with new model releases, particularly those that employ novel architectures or implementations. In our testing of Alibaba's QwQ, we found that misconfiguring the model hyperparameters could result in excessively long responses.

We've also heard claims that we trained on test sets - that's simply not true and we would never do that

Al-Dahle also denied allegations Meta had cheated by training Llama 4 on LLM benchmark test sets. ""We've also heard claims that we trained on test sets - that's simply not true and we would never do that. Our best understanding is that the variable quality people are seeing is due to needing to stabilize implementations.""

The company is also expanding Teen Accounts to two of its other big platforms, Facebook and Messenger.

Instagram Teen Accounts launched back in September with new safety features to protect teenagers from strangers and potentially harmful content. Teenagers who create Instagram accounts automatically get a teen account, and those under 16 need a parent’s permission to change any of the security settings that are enabled by default.

In the coming months, Instagram will automatically prevent teens under 16 from going live unless their parents allow it. The platform will also introduce another control to blur images containing suspected nudity in Instagram DMs, which will also be enabled by default for Teen Accounts.

Starting today, Teen Accounts are also available on Facebook and Messenger, beginning in the US, UK, Australia, and Canada. “Teen Accounts on Facebook and Messenger will offer similar, automatic protections to limit inappropriate content and unwanted contact, as well as ways to ensure teens’ time is well spent,” the company said.

In other Meta-related news, the company also ended its third-party fact-checking program in the US yesterday after announcing plans to do so in January. The company is replacing fact-check labels on posts with a new Community Notes system on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. Just like on X/Twitter, these notes will be written and rated by users themselves, and Meta previously said that it expects these crowdsourced notes to be “less biased” because they will “allow more people with more perspectives to add context to posts.”",0.9843,0.018,0.866,0.116

Initially launched on Instagram in September 2024, this initiative aims to provide a safer and more controlled environment for teenagers.​ From now on, teens under 16 will require parental consent to access certain features.

Instagram Live Restrictions: Users under 16 are prohibited from initiating live broadcasts unless granted permission by a parent or guardian.​

Users under 16 are prohibited from initiating live broadcasts unless granted permission by a parent or guardian.​ Direct Message Content Controls: A new feature will automatically blur images containing suspected nudity in direct messages. Teens will need parental approval to disable this protective measure.

The rollout will begin in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, with plans to reach additional regions in the near future.

Since the introduction of Teen Accounts on Instagram, 97% of teens aged 13 to 15 have maintained the default protective settings. Furthermore, a survey conducted by Ipsos revealed that 94% of U.S. parents found the Teen Accounts helpful, and 85% believed these protections facilitated positive experiences for their teens on Instagram.

This expansion to Facebook and Messenger will offer similar automatic safeguards designed to limit exposure to inappropriate content and unwanted interactions.

Meta says it is committed to continuously refining its platforms to better serve and protect teen users. This includes exploring industry-wide approaches to age verification and collaborating with policymakers to establish robust safety standards across the digital landscape.

And there's more to come.,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/your-teens-instagram-account-protections-are-coming-to-facebook-and-messenger/,2025-04-08,"Worried about what your kids might be up to on social media? If so, Meta's continued crackdown on teen safety might come as a relief. The company announced Tuesday that, starting immediately, it's expanding its Instagram Teen Accounts to other platforms, specifically, Facebook and Messenger.

It also announced additional built-in protections for Instagram Teen Accounts. These will prevent children under the age of 16 from going live on the platform or turning off blurred images, which protect against suspected nudity in direct messages, without parental permission.

Meta first launched Instagram Teen Accounts back in September 2024, in a bid to make the platform a safer place for kids and provide more oversight and supervision options for parents. In an update on Tuesday, the company said it had switched 54 million accounts to become Teen Accounts so far, with more to go. The accounts offer built-in protections, including being set to private by default and a hidden words feature, which will automatically filter out problematic comments and DM requests.

With parental agreement, some of these features can be switched off, but Meta said that so far 97% of teens aged between 13 and 15 had kept the default safeguards in place. In a Meta-commissioned survey undertaken by Ipsos, the company said that 94% of parents found the protections helpful, with 85% saying it made it easier to have positive experiences on Instagram. The company didn't say how many parents it surveyed, or where they were situated.

Child safety: Who is responsible?

Children's safety campaigners have been asking social media companies for years to make their platforms safer for kids, and while progress has been slow, Meta's recognition that teens need different protections than adults to the extent that they require a different kind of account has been an important breakthrough. Other platforms have followed suit, with TikTok introducing new parental controls last month.

But at the same time as introducing teen accounts, Meta has come under fire for rolling back safety protections elsewhere on its platforms. Just this week, the company has ceased its fact-checking program and more broadly it's also scanning for harmful content in order to promote more free speech.

""In recent months, it has been deeply concerning to see Meta roll back on their duty to protect children,"" said Matthew Sowemimo, associate head of policy for child safety online at UK children's charity the NSPCC over email. ""While their move to expand these safety features to both Facebook and Messenger is welcome, more work must be done to ensure children have positive experiences online -- including on both private and public parts of these platforms.""

For the changes brought about by the introduction of teen accounts to be most effective, they should be combined with proactive measures to reduce harmful content across Meta's platforms, Sowemimo added. ""While safety settings play an important role in preventing online harm, we know changes to account settings can result in accountability falling onto children and parents to keep themselves safe online,"" he said.",0.9984,0.026,0.786,0.188

The enhanced privacy and parental controls, which were introduced on Instagram last year, will address concerns about how teens are spending their time on social media, the company said.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

Meta's expansion of safety features for teens comes as some lawmakers say they plan to press ahead with proposed legislation, such as the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), seeking to protect children from social media harms.

Meta, ByteDance's TikTok and Google's YouTube already face hundreds of lawsuits filed on behalf of children and school districts about the addictive nature of social media.

In 2023, 33 U.S. states including California and New York sued the company for misleading the public about the dangers of its platforms.

CONTEXT

Meta said teens under 16 will require parental permission before they can go live and disable a feature that automatically blurs images potentially containing nudity in direct messages.

""We will start including these updates in the next couple of months,"" the company said.

In July 2024, the U.S. Senate advanced two online safety bills — KOSA and The Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act — that would force social media companies to take responsibility for how their platforms affect children and teens.

The Republican-led House declined to bring KOSA up for a vote last year, but suggested at a committee hearing late last month that they still plan to press ahead with new laws to protect kids online.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Budget Allocation: When To Choose Google Ads Vs. Meta Ads,"Google Ads or Meta Ads: Where should your budget go? Compare costs, intent, and performance to make the smartest choice for your business goals.
The post Budget Allocation: When To Choose Google Ads Vs. Meta Ads appeared first on Search Engine Journal.",https://www.searchenginejournal.com/budget-allocation-when-to-choose-google-ads-vs-meta-ads/542850/,2025-04-07,"Choosing between Google Ads and Meta Ads isn’t about which platform is better. It’s about which makes more sense for your goals, audience, and spend.

As both platforms continue to change with smarter automation, stricter privacy rules, and rising ad costs, advertisers need a framework for deciding where their budgets go.

Here’s how to think it through.

Google Ads Vs. Meta Ads: The Core Difference

Google Ads is built around user intent.

Whether it’s [best CRM for real estate agents] or [emergency plumber near me], that intent translates into higher conversion potential because people come to Google actively looking for solutions.

Meta Ads (Facebook and Instagram) are driven by discovery.

You’re placing ad content in front of users who weren’t searching for your product but might be persuaded to click, browse, or buy.

This makes Meta stronger for brand awareness, lifestyle products, and impulse-driven purchases.

In short, Google wins when users know what they want. Meta wins when you want to influence what they want.

When Google Ads Make More Sense

Google Ads is the platform to choose when search volume and purchase intent are high.

Legal services, home service providers, and B2B companies often perform better in Google because they solve specific problems people are actively researching.

The cost-per-click (CPC) is especially high in competitive industries like home services or law, but the quality of traffic and the high payout often justifies the spend.

CPCs in home services verticals can exceed $6.50 and legal can exceed $8.50 (most up-to-date numbers from 2024).

It’s also a strong fit for ecommerce brands.

Someone searching for [black corset sundress] or [best gaming laptop under $1,500] is closer to buying than someone casually swiping through Instagram.

Google Shopping Ads and Performance Max campaigns can be great campaigns to streamline the purchase path.

Local businesses also benefit from Google’s ecosystem, especially with Local Services Ads.

When Meta Ads Outperform

Meta shines when you aim to build demand, but it’s not limited to just awareness or engagement.

For many ecommerce brands, Meta is a primary driver of direct conversions, especially when the product is aesthetically pleasing, impulse-friendly, or supported by strong creative assets.

Campaign types like Advantage+ Shopping, paired with dynamic product ads, won’t just help your brand get noticed; they can drive sales right away, too.

What makes Meta effective is how it is able to blend product discovery with fast action, which makes it a great tool for new product launches, lifestyle products, and visually driven goods like fashion, beauty, or home decor.

Its creative formats, Reels, Stories, and Carousels offer brands the flexibility to tell a compelling story and convert in the same swipe.

It’s also the better choice for lower-budget campaigns. The 2024 Facebook Ads benchmarks show a $1.88 CPC across all industries compared to Google’s $4.66.

Meta also leans into AI to adapt to the post-iOS 14 landscape. Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns and the Conversions API help automate targeting and placements while making up for lost third-party data.

Lead generation for B2C brands can perform well on Meta, too, especially with strong creative and clear calls to action.

With the right mix of assets, like product demos, influencer content, and user-generated content, Meta can drive results well beyond just awareness.

What’s Changing In 2025 And Why It Affects Budget Decisions

Rising ad costs are forcing marketers to be more deliberate with every dollar.

Google’s Smart Bidding and Meta’s Advantage+ now automate most of the optimization process, from placements to bidding strategies.

However, they’re not one-size-fits-all. Without a clear structure, reliable creative inputs, and regular human oversight, automation can just as easily waste budget as performance scales.

The dominance of short-form videos has changed ad creatives. Formats like YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and Facebook Stories capture more attention and often outperform static ads in both reach and cost efficiency.

First-party data is now essential for advanced targeting.

Google’s Customer Match and Meta’s Conversions API offer better performance if you have the data to feed them – this is where scale matters.

Large brands with thousands of customers can activate precise targeting strategies. For small businesses, platform-led targeting or broader lookalikes often remain the better bet.

How To Allocate Your Budget

Unfortunately, there’s no universal formula for dividing the budget between Google Ads and Meta Ads. What works for one brand may fail for another.

Instead, I would suggest evaluating your budget not just by platform but by objective, funnel stage, product type, and customer behavior.

Start With Intent

If your target customer is actively looking for a solution, whether it’s a personal injury lawyer, an enterprise SaaS tool, or a plumber at 3 a.m. Google Ads is where you’ll see the highest return.

Paid search captures high-intent traffic at the moment of need, and in these scenarios, it’s often smart to allocate 70% or more of your ad budget to Google.

Meta simply isn’t built to catch bottom-of-funnel demand like that.

Here’s a good way to frame this:

Ask yourself, “Does my customer know they need this?” If the answer is yes, test Google first.

If, instead, you’re thinking, “I need to tell my customer why they need this,” test Meta first.

If you’re not sure whether your customers know they need your product or service, start with keyword research. If there’s a high search volume, Google likely deserves a larger share of your budget.

If You’re Building A Brand, Lean Into Meta

Meta Ads does great in categories where brand identity, lifestyle associations, and storytelling drive consideration.

This makes Instagram and Facebook ideal for brands launching new products, entering crowded markets, or selling aesthetics-first items like skincare, fashion, or home decor.

In these cases, it’s common to see brands allocate 70% of their budget to Meta, especially when early-stage awareness or engagement is a priority.

Ecommerce Brands Need A Dual Strategy

For product-driven businesses, the platform split often comes down to product price points and customer buying behavior.

High-ticket or research-heavy products, like fitness equipment, electronics, or furniture, usually perform better on Google.

Lower-priced, impulse-friendly products, like jewelry, apparel, or novelty gifts, often convert faster on Meta, where users aren’t actively searching but are open to discovery.

A 50/50 split is a good starting point, but the performance data should quickly tell you whether to skew heavier toward search or social.

Lead Generation Requires Funnel-Specific Planning

For B2B lead gen, Google Ads is the platform where you’ll receive higher-quality leads due to the higher intent of the query.

If your sales process is long or consultative, Google is worth the majority of your spend.

However, Meta can be cost-effective for B2C lead gen, especially offers like product waitlists or newsletter opt-ins.

Meta’s audience targeting and creative tools can nurture users through the early stages of the funnel.

Budget splits here can range from 60/40 to 40/60 depending on your customer and conversion goals.

Testing Is Your Real Allocation Strategy

Budgeting isn’t a set-it-and-forget-it model.

Allocate a small portion of your budget to test both platforms. Validate which creative, copy, audiences, and formats drive the best results.

Don’t just test platforms. Test offers, price points, landing pages, and funnel sequences.

A $250 test campaign split evenly across Google and Meta can give you more insights than a bloated campaign stuck on a single channel.

Make Your Budget Flexible, Not Fixed

Most successful brands don’t work with rigid splits. They start with a hypothesis, test quickly, and reallocate monthly (or weekly) based on data.

Seasonality, promotions, creative fatigue, and even news cycles can impact which platform is more effective at any given time.

If your entire budget is tied to one platform year-round, you’re probably leaving money on the table.

Final Word: Don’t Pick One. Build A Hybrid Strategy

The most effective advertisers aren’t choosing between Google and Meta. They’re building strategies that leverage both.

Use Google Ads when you need to convert high-intent search traffic. Use Meta Ads when you’re building demand, launching a product, or nurturing an audience.

Invest in creative work that works across platforms, especially video. Lean into automation, but keep a close eye on performance.

Most importantly, stay flexible. What works in Q1 may fail in Q3. Let data, not assumptions, shape your budget decisions.

Algorithm-driven doomscrolling is rotting your brain.

To be online in 2025 is to be miserable. A lot of that is the current state of the world, to be fair, but some of it is also the way we all engage with stuff online. We’ve all sat down to browse Instagram and looked up to realize two hours have passed that we barely remember. And it seems as if the feed on every social media site is filled with AI slop, advertisements, and weird garbage we don’t want to see.

But there is something you can do. The top line is that you must stop being a passive participant online and get better control over what comes across your various feeds. It’s possible. I’ve done it, and you can, too. I won’t lie; this will be work. You might have to install some software, learn some new tools, and even pay for some things.

I promise it’s worth it.

It’s not the algorithm, it’s you

Who do we blame when it’s 2 a.m. and we’re watching our 50th YouTube short in bed? The algorithm. What do we want to destroy when we realize our Instagram feed is full of tarot card readers and spellcasters? The algorithm. “It’s not my fault,” we say to ourselves. “It’s just what the algorithm is serving me.”

That’s cope, a cop-out, and it’s how Big Tech wins. Yes, many of these companies have powerful algorithms designed to keep you enchanted and scrolling. But the heart of the problem is you. In the age of social media and being extremely online, some of us have chosen to eat the swill that companies like Meta and Google serve up to us.

A recent video from the YouTuber Technology Connections identified the problem and named it. “I’m starting to see evidence that an increasing number of folks actually prefer to let a computer program decide what they will see when they log on, even when they know they have an alternative,” Technology Connections said in their video. “I’ve chosen to call it algorithmic complacency.”

The YouTube video does a great job of breaking down what we’re losing by letting algorithms decide what we see online. It also offers a great place to start breaking the cycle: YouTube. I have a friend who complains that YouTube is attempting to turn him into a right-wing ideologue. He watches a lot of news on the site and believes that the algorithm is warping his newsfeed to make him more conservative. He also doesn’t subscribe to any channels. And as such, he’s at the mercy of the algorithm. It doesn’t have to be this way.

YouTube is one of the easiest sites to fix. It allows anyone to see a pure feed of only the channels they’ve subscribed to. This is the link to it. If you use a bookmark or button to take you directly to YouTube, make it point to this URL instead of the YouTube homepage. That way whenever you go to the site, you’re just seeing the latest stuff from creators you already know you like.

No, this doesn’t help with discovering new stuff, but I’ll explain how to solve that issue at the end of this piece. What it does is make it so you see videos from creators you already know you like. It skips over the algorithm and takes you directly to the stuff you wanna see. It gives you control over your experience.

Use an RSS reader

This is an old and powerful technique and if you master it you can be free of many online problems.

Every morning I spend the first hour of my day reading the news and various niche websites. To do this, I pull up an RSS reader, like Feedly, and sort through a list of the latest material from all the websites I find interesting in chronological order. Instead of going to the homepage of the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, or Wired, I open my RSS reader and see everything all in one list. I scan the headlines, read some things, discard others, save some things for later, and go about my day.

Almost everything has a default RSS feed. Government websites, substacks, newsletters, blogs, all generate RSS feeds. This is Gizmodo’s. Good RSS readers will let you plug in custom URLs so you can set up a feed to, say, track incoming packages from FedEx or UPS. Hell, you can even convert those YouTube subscriptions into an RSS feed.

There are a lot of different readers out there and you’ll have to play around with them to figure out what you like and what works for you. I use NewsBlur, which costs $36 a year but has a lot of features and customization options.

Ditch Google search

This one took me the longest to do. It’ll probably take you the longest to do. If you want search results that don’t suck, you’re going to have to pay for them. I know. I’m sorry.

A few weeks ago I was trying to find an old story of mine using Google search. No matter what combinations of keywords I typed in, the story would not appear. It wasn’t on the first page, it wasn’t on the second page, it wasn’t on the third page. I was awash in AI-generated answers to a question I hadn’t asked, landing pages for outlets I work at, and tangentially related news material.

In my frustration, I went to Kagi.com and bought a subscription to its search engine. The story I was looking for was the first result on the first page after the first search. You can try Kagi for free for 100 searches. It’s $5 for 500 searches after that and $10 a month for unlimited searches.

I resisted this one for a long time, but now that I’ve started using it I can’t go back. Google search is broken and Kagi works like magic.

Take control of social media or turn them into RSS feeds

This is another difficult one.

Social media platforms are another place where algorithmic-driven doomscrolling controls our lives. It’s on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, BlueSky, X, and Reddit where our brains go to die. But you have options. They all rely on control and a little labor upfront.

Like YouTube, many—though not all—social media platforms allow you to just see a feed of people you’re following or subscribed to. You can’t do this on the web-based version of Instagram, but you can on Android and iOS. If you must be on X, stick to the “following” tab and never touch the “for you” tab. BlueSky allows you to cultivate lists of accounts based on areas of interest. Reddit allows you to subscribe to what you want to see.

Every day you get on social media, do it with an active goal in mind. Pick a time and scroll through what’s been posted by the people you actually care about. Stick with what you’ve subscribed to. If you want to get really wild, you can use a number of programs to convert social media feeds into, you guessed it, RSS.

Here’s one for Instagram. The same company makes one for Facebook. Inoreader is a good RSS reader that will allow you to convert social media accounts and even LinkedIn posts into RSS feeds.

Put time limits on doomscrolling

Look, sometimes you just want to let your brain run free in a sea of mush. Sometimes you just want to flip your finger along the screen and let the endless Reddit threads and Instagram Reels flash before your eyes. As well as having a lovely narcotizing effect, this kind of scrolling does help you discover things you want to subscribe to that you may not have noticed otherwise.

But you need to set hard limits on the amount of time you scroll. I’m going to suggest 15 minutes knowing that many of you will set the upper limit of the scroll at 30 minutes or even an hour. How do you enforce this rule? A timer and not one that is on the device you’re using. You need to make something across the room beep when it’s time to put the phone down. You need your oven or microwave to yell at you when the timer goes off.

The point of the alarm is to get you off your feet and moving around. Just changing your physical position and focusing on something that isn’t your phone, laptop, tablet, or desktop will sometimes be enough to free you from the clutches of the algorithm.

"META Platforms, Facebook.","Facebook, Instagram and Threads Will Stop Fact-Checking As of Today",Meta's chief global affairs officer says the company will officially stop fact checking on Monday after announcing a shift to Community Notes in January.,https://www.cnet.com/news/social-media/facebook-instagram-and-threads-will-stop-fact-checking-as-of-today/,2025-04-07,"The era of Facebook, Instagram and Threads using fact-checking to verify information on its platforms is over, as of Monday, April 7, according to Meta's chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan. He said in a post on X, ""By Monday afternoon, our fact-checking program in the US will be officially over. That means no new fact checks and no fact checkers.""

In early January, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was going to wind down its decade-old program using third-party fact-checkers approved by the International Fact-Checking Network, to verify Facebook and Instagram posts, including videos and images.

Now Meta will be using Community Notes generated by the users themselves. ""In place of fact checks, the first Community Notes will start appearing gradually across Facebook, Threads & Instagram, with no penalties attached,"" Kaplan said in his post.

Meta's announcement in early January came weeks before the inauguration of President Donald Trump for a second term. It was part of a large shift among some of the top tech companies including Apple, Amazon and Google to more closely align with the new administration's agenda. X owner Elon Musk replied to Kaplan's post on X with, ""Cool.""

Effects of the change not yet known

X launched Community Notes in 2021, but did not do away with fact checking in addition to them until after Musk's 2022 purchase of the platform, formerly Twitter.

It's unclear if they are any more or less effective than professional fact checking, but whatever method is used, they have both been up against an ever-increasing tidal wave of misinformation. Anjana Susarla, who specializes in topics including AI and social media at Michigan State University's Broad College of Business, said the two biggest challenges for countering false information on these platforms are the volume of posts to be dealt with and whether users engage with the solutions.

""It's not that Community Notes are not helpful,"" she said, ""it's that the scale and the volume that exists on these very large platforms, the volume of debunking... can you debunk things with the same speed (as fact checking)? Second, will engagement be lower if you have these Community Notes? How effective are they?""

Susarla says that if readers don't trust Community Notes or fact checking, they're unlikely to engage with that information and there's not enough data yet on which is more useful or preferable to users.

""Evidence is mixed,"" she said, ""we don't have too many large-scale studies on that.""

One alternate to either of these approaches, she said, is something like what Wikipedia does: relying on crowdsourcing for information, but also including community editors in the mix to help verify information. It's unclear, she said, whether that kind of approach would work on such huge platforms, and whether it would help build trust among users.

Susarla noted that the timing of Meta shutting down fact checking was on the same day that financial markets were melting down over global tariff concerns. She said, ""If you are going to Facebook to find out about the stock market, it's not necessarily a great time.""",0.9765,0.047,0.86,0.092
"META Platforms, Facebook.",LinkedIn Leads in Engagement at 6.50% — Here’s How Other Platforms Stack Up,We dug into the engagement rate data of eight social media platforms.,https://buffer.com/resources/average-engagement-rate/,2025-04-07,"Think you know which social platform has the most engagement? The data might surprise you.

Social media trends are always evolving, but lately, engagement has been shifting in unexpected ways. LinkedIn is seeing record-high interactions, Pinterest is quietly on the rise, and Threads — once a breakout success — is settling into more stable patterns. Meanwhile, Instagram’s engagement is lower than ever, but that doesn’t mean it’s losing relevance.

If you’ve ever felt like social media engagement is unpredictable, you’re not alone. But while platforms and algorithms change, one thing remains the same: understanding the data gives you an edge.

At Buffer, we analyzed millions of posts across LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, X, Threads, and Pinterest to uncover where engagement is thriving, slowing down, and what it all means for your content strategy.

Here’s what we found:

Which platforms have the highest and lowest engagement rates this year

How audience behavior is shifting across social media

What’s behind LinkedIn’s engagement surge and Instagram’s engagement dip

How to adjust your content strategy based on 2025’s engagement trends

If you want to stay ahead of the curve and make smarter content decisions, this article has the insights you need.

Let’s dive in.

What is engagement rate and why does it matter?

Engagement rate is one of the most important social media metrics — but it’s also one of the most misunderstood.

At its core, engagement rate measures how much people interact with your content relative to how many people see it. It’s not just about visibility — it’s about connection.

For example:

A post that reaches 10,000 people but gets only a few likes? Low engagement.

A post that reaches 1,000 people but sparks hundreds of interactions? High engagement.

That’s why engagement rate is one of the strongest indicators of content performance. It tells you:

How well your content connects with your audience.

How likely your content is to be amplified by the platform’s algorithm.

Whether your audience is passive or actively engaging.

The key considerations about engagement rate data

Before we dive into the rankings, here are some key considerations to reflect the nuance of this report:

Engagement rate ≠ Total engagement volume. Platforms with massive reach — like Instagram — may have lower engagement rates but still drive more total interactions than smaller, higher-engagement platforms like LinkedIn. A 1% engagement rate on Instagram could mean thousands of interactions, while a 6% engagement rate on LinkedIn might result in far fewer total engagements.

Platforms with massive reach — like Instagram — may have lower engagement rates but still drive more total interactions than smaller, higher-engagement platforms like LinkedIn. A 1% engagement rate on Instagram could mean thousands of interactions, while a 6% engagement rate on LinkedIn might result in far fewer total engagements. Each platform encourages different behaviors. LinkedIn prioritizes comments and discussions, while Instagram thrives on shares and saves. These behavioral differences mean a 6% engagement rate on LinkedIn doesn’t equate to a 6% engagement rate on TikTok.

LinkedIn prioritizes comments and discussions, while Instagram thrives on shares and saves. These behavioral differences mean a 6% engagement rate on LinkedIn doesn’t equate to a 6% engagement rate on TikTok. What counts as engagement varies by platform. Saves on Instagram, pins on Pinterest, and comments on YouTube all count as engagement, but they reflect different user behaviors and levels of intent.

Saves on Instagram, pins on Pinterest, and comments on YouTube all count as engagement, but they reflect different user behaviors and levels of intent. Not all engagement is public. Private interactions — like bookmarks, DMs, and link clicks — aren’t always reflected in engagement rate calculations.

How we calculate engagement rate

At Buffer, we calculate engagement rate using the following formula:

(Total Interactions / Total Impressions) × 100 = Engagement Rate (%)

To provide the most accurate view of engagement trends, we analyze engagement rates in two ways:

Averages which help us compare platforms at a high level—showing where engagement is strongest overall.

which help us compare platforms at a high level—showing where engagement is strongest overall. Medians over time which reveal the story of how engagement is evolving month by month.

Now that we understand what engagement rate really measures — and its nuances across platforms — let’s get into the rankings.

Average engagement rates by platform: Who’s leading the engagement game?

To determine where users are engaging the most, we analyzed average engagement rates across eight major social platforms over a one-year timeframe. Here’s how they stack up:

Platform Average Engagement Rate (%) LinkedIn 6.50% 📈 Facebook 5.07% TikTok 4.86% Threads 4.51% YouTube 4.41% Pinterest 3.46% X (Twitter) 2.31% Instagram 1.16%

At first glance, the average engagement rates across these platforms tell us a few key things:

LinkedIn is the top performer. With a median engagement rate of 6.50% , LinkedIn has outpaced all other platforms

With a , LinkedIn has outpaced all other platforms Facebook engagement remains steady . At 5.07%, Facebook continues to generate strong engagement

. At 5.07%, Facebook continues to generate strong engagement TikTok ranks higher than YouTube for engagement . With 4.86%, TikTok remains a leader for short-form video, with YouTube not far behind with 4.41%

. With 4.86%, TikTok remains a leader for short-form video, with YouTube not far behind with 4.41% Threads has outpaced X/Twitter in engagement . Threads’ 4.51% engagement rate is significantly higher than X’s 2.31%

. Threads’ 4.51% engagement rate is significantly higher than X’s 2.31% Instagram’s engagement rate is the lowest. At 1.16%, Instagram’s engagement is significantly lower than other platforms, though private interactions (DMs, saves) likely contribute to hidden engagement that isn’t captured in public metrics.

Now, while these median numbers provide a broad comparison of which platforms drive the most engagement overall, they don’t capture how engagement has shifted over time.

To understand how engagement is evolving, we decided to look at median engagement rates over the year between January 2024 to January 2025.

Engagement patterns between January 2024 to January 2025

Engagement rates don’t exist in a vacuum. User behavior, algorithm changes, and broader industry shifts all influence how people interact with content.

While the overall median engagement rates tell us which platforms perform best overall, the median engagement rates over time reveal how engagement is changing month by month.

Here’s what we found from analyzing median engagement rates from January 2024 to January 2025.

1. LinkedIn’s engagement is steadily rising

With an average engagement rate of 6.50%, LinkedIn leads all platforms, but the real story is its growth over time.

In January 2024, LinkedIn’s median engagement rate was 6.00%. By January 2025, it had risen to 8.01%.

What could be driving this increase?

Less content saturation = higher visibility. Only 1% of LinkedIn users post regularly, meaning content has less competition and more potential reach.

Only 1% of LinkedIn users post regularly, meaning content has less competition and more potential reach. The algorithm rewards conversations. Posts with early engagement are boosted to second- and third-degree connections, expanding visibility.

Posts with early engagement are boosted to second- and third-degree connections, expanding visibility. More diverse content formats are succeeding. Carousels see significant engagement, and the platform just introduced video.

LinkedIn remains the strongest platform for authority-building and organic reach. If you’ve been posting inconsistently, now is the time to lean in.

2. Instagram’s engagement is evolving

While Instagram has the lowest average engagement rate (1.16%), its interaction patterns are shifting rather than simply declining.

In January 2024, Instagram’s median engagement rate was 2.94%. By January 2025, it had adjusted to 0.61%.

This change reflects a broader shift in how users engage with content rather than a loss of platform relevance. What’s behind the shift?

More content is being consumed than ever. With reels and stories dominating, users are watching more but interacting differently — passive engagement is rising, even if likes and comments aren’t as visible.

With reels and stories dominating, users are watching more but interacting differently — passive engagement is rising, even if likes and comments aren’t as visible. Engagement is becoming more private. Saves, DMs, and shares are increasing, but these interactions don’t contribute to public engagement metrics.

Saves, DMs, and shares are increasing, but these interactions don’t contribute to public engagement metrics. Reels success depends on depth, not just views. High-performing reels tend to spark conversation or encourage sharing, while others may generate views without direct engagement.

Instagram engagement isn’t disappearing — it’s moving behind the scenes. Create saveable content for the algorithm, share your posts with friends, and reply via DM — that’s where real engagement is happening.

3. Threads’ engagement is stabilizing after an initial surge

Threads launched with high engagement, but its numbers have steadily declined from 4.76% in February 2024 to 3.60% in February 2025. While Threads still outperforms X/Twitter in engagement rate, its growth phase has leveled out.

What’s behind the shift?

The early adopter effect is fading. When Threads launched, engagement was high as users explored the platform. As more users join, engagement is now spreading out across a larger content pool.

When Threads launched, engagement was high as users explored the platform. As more users join, engagement is now spreading out across a larger content pool. More content = more competition. Initially, with fewer users posting, content was more visible. Now, as more creators share content, engagement is becoming more distributed.

Initially, with fewer users posting, content was more visible. Now, as more creators share content, engagement is becoming more distributed. **Algorithm shifts are influencing visibility.** Threads started with a purely chronological feed, but Meta has since introduced ranking signals, making engagement less predictable.

Threads remains a high-engagement platform, but success now depends on participation, not just presence. Prioritizing conversations, real-time engagement, and interactive content will help sustain engagement as the platform matures.

💡 We only started collecting engagement data from Threads in February 2024.

4. TikTok engagement remains high, but patterns are changing

With an average engagement rate of 4.86%, TikTok is still one of the strongest platforms for engagement, but its median engagement rate has gradually declined from 5.14% in January 2024 to 4.56% in January 2025.

What’s behind the shift?

TikTok’s algorithm is rewarding retention over interactions.** Watch time and replays are now bigger engagement drivers than likes or comments, shifting what “high engagement” looks like on the platform. Pro tip: Keep your videos above 1-minute as we’ve found that longer TikToks perform better in the algorithm.

Short-form video competition is increasing. With Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and even LinkedIn embracing video, TikTok is no longer the only dominant player in the space.

With Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and even LinkedIn embracing video, TikTok is no longer the only dominant player in the space. More brands and advertisers = more polished content. TikTok’s early success was built on authentic, unpolished content, but as brands ramp up their presence, engagement rates have become less predictable.

TikTok is still a powerhouse for engagement, but the type of engagement that matters is shifting. Focus on content that drives watch time and shares, not just likes and comments.

5. YouTube Shorts engagement is catching up to TikTok

YouTube Shorts’ 4.41% average engagement rate puts it just behind TikTok, but its median engagement rate has risen from 3.95% in January 2024 to 4.71% in January 2025.

What’s driving the increase?

YouTube’s search advantage. Unlike TikTok, YouTube content is discoverable long after posting, meaning shorts have a longer engagement lifespan than TikTok videos.

Unlike TikTok, YouTube content is discoverable long after posting, meaning shorts have a longer engagement lifespan than TikTok videos. Higher audience intent. YouTube users are actively searching for content, while TikTok users are passively scrolling, leading to more engaged viewers on shorts.

YouTube users are actively searching for content, while TikTok users are passively scrolling, leading to more engaged viewers on shorts. Monetization is attracting creators. With more ad revenue opportunities, creators are investing more in shorts content, leading to higher-quality videos that retain engagement.

YouTube Shorts is becoming a major competitor to TikTok for short-form video. If you’re already creating vertical video content, repurposing it for shorts could extend its lifespan and reach.

6. Pinterest’s engagement is quietly rising

Pinterest engagement has grown from 3.08% in January 2024 to 5.26% in January 2025, making it one of the strongest platforms for long-term engagement.

Why is Pinterest growing?

It’s a search-driven platform, not a feed-based one. Unlike TikTok or Instagram, Pinterest users actively seek out content, meaning engagement is more intentional than passive scrolling.

Unlike TikTok or Instagram, Pinterest users actively seek out content, meaning engagement is more intentional than passive scrolling. Pins have a long shelf life. A single Pin can generate engagement for months or even years, unlike Instagram posts that disappear quickly.

A single Pin can generate engagement for months or even years, unlike Instagram posts that disappear quickly. More users are treating Pinterest like a search engine. As Google’s search algorithms shift, more users are turning to Pinterest for inspiration and discovery.

If you create evergreen content — such as guides, tutorials, and infographics — Pinterest offers long-term engagement potential. Unlike other platforms where content fades quickly, your content on Pinterest can drive engagement long after you post it.

7. Facebook’s engagement remains steady despite changes

Facebook’s 5.07% average engagement rate is strong, and its median engagement rate has remained stable at around 5.45% over the past year.

Why is Facebook engagement holding steady?

Facebook Groups continue to drive strong engagement. Unlike brand pages, niche Groups see some of the highest interaction rates on the platform.

Unlike brand pages, niche Groups see some of the highest interaction rates on the platform. Meta is investing in new monetization tools. Features like subscriptions, Facebook reels monetization, and ad revenue sharing are keeping creators active.

Features like subscriptions, Facebook reels monetization, and ad revenue sharing are keeping creators active. Facebook’s demographic is highly engaged. While younger audiences gravitate toward TikTok and Instagram, Facebook’s core user base (ages 30+) remains actively engaged.

Facebook remains a high-value platform for community-driven engagement — especially if you leverage Groups and interactive content.

X (formerly Twitter) has dropped from 3.47% in January 2024 to 2.15% in January 2025, making it the second-lowest platform for engagement after Instagram.

What’s driving the decline?

Algorithm changes have reduced organic reach.** X is prioritizing paid subscribers and recommended content, making organic engagement harder to achieve.

More users are lurking rather than engaging. Many users consume content without liking, commenting, or reposting, leading to lower engagement rates.

Many users consume content without liking, commenting, or reposting, leading to lower engagement rates. Platform instability is affecting creator investment. With frequent policy shifts and monetization changes, fewer creators are prioritizing X.

Unless you’re focused on news, politics, or real-time commentary, engagement on X will require more effort and consistency to maintain.

What the data means for your content strategy

Knowing where engagement is highest is one thing — figuring out how to use that insight in your strategy is another.

A high engagement rate doesn’t automatically make a platform the best fit for you. The key question is: What are your goals, and which platform aligns with them?

Here’s how to refine your approach based on the data.

1. Pick the platform that aligns with your goals

Not all engagement is equal, and different platforms serve different purposes. Here's how you can adjust based on what you're trying to achieve:

For high engagement per post: Focus on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Pinterest. LinkedIn and Facebook have strong engagement through comments and community-driven content. Pinterest excels at evergreen content, driving steady engagement long after posting.

Focus on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Pinterest. LinkedIn and Facebook have strong engagement through comments and community-driven content. Pinterest excels at evergreen content, driving steady engagement long after posting. For massive reach potential: Go with Instagram and TikTok. While Instagram’s engagement rate may be lower, it offers vast reach, and TikTok’s discovery algorithm allows even smaller accounts to go viral.

Go with Instagram and TikTok. While Instagram’s engagement rate may be lower, it offers vast reach, and TikTok’s discovery algorithm allows even smaller accounts to go viral. For video-focused engagement: TikTok and YouTube Shorts are the best platforms. Short-form video drives some of the highest engagement rates, and repurposing video across platforms (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram) can boost your reach without extra work.

TikTok and YouTube Shorts are the best platforms. Short-form video drives some of the highest engagement rates, and repurposing video across platforms (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram) can boost your reach without extra work. For real-time conversations: If your goal is immediate interactions, go with Threads or X (Twitter). Both excel in real-time discussions, with Threads gaining traction for organic engagement and X still being key for news-driven content.

Takeaway: Instead of trying to be everywhere, focus on the platforms that align with your specific goals. Don’t just chase high engagement rates — consider how each platform fits your content objectives.

2. Adapt your content format for each platform

Each platform prioritizes different formats based on user behavior. Here’s how you can tailor your content:

LinkedIn is about conversation starters. Use long-form posts, carousels, and documents to encourage discussions and showcase expertise.

Instagram’s engagement is increasingly happening behind the scenes — so focus on Reels that generate saves and shares, not just likes.

TikTok favors content that keeps people watching. Go for quick hooks and engaging narratives that are visually compelling from the start.

Pinterest excels with evergreen content that gets better over time. High-quality visuals, step-by-step guides, and search-optimized content will perform best here.

Takeaway: Tailor your content to the platform—what works on Instagram doesn’t necessarily work on LinkedIn. Focus on creating platform-first content that aligns with user expectations and engagement behaviors.

3. Fine-tune your posting strategy for maximum engagement

Engagement isn’t just about what you post — it’s about when and how often you post. Each platform rewards different posting behaviors, so optimizing your frequency is key.

For LinkedIn and Facebook: Focus on quality over quantity. Posts that sustain engagement over time tend to do better, so one well-crafted post a few times a week can be enough.

Focus on quality over quantity. Posts that sustain engagement over time tend to do better, so one well-crafted post a few times a week can be enough. For Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts: These platforms thrive on frequency. Post daily to increase visibility and maintain engagement, but always prioritize quality content that resonates with your audience.

These platforms thrive on frequency. Post daily to increase visibility and maintain engagement, but always prioritize quality content that resonates with your audience. For Threads and X: Engage in real-time conversations — post multiple times a day if possible, but engage actively with others’ content to build a community.

Takeaway: Match your posting frequency to the platform’s algorithm. Some platforms reward quality posts over consistency (LinkedIn, Facebook), while others, like TikTok and Instagram, reward daily posts that build momentum.

Play to the strengths of each platform

A high engagement rate doesn’t automatically mean a platform is the right fit for you. What matters most is how well a platform aligns with your goals — whether that’s visibility, deep engagement, video performance, or real-time interaction.

Instead of trying to be everywhere at once, focus on the platforms that play to your strengths and audience behaviors. Adapt your content format, posting strategy, and engagement approach to work with the strengths of each platform rather than against them.",1.0,0.021,0.7,0.278
"META Platforms, Facebook.",Facebook Announces Official End Date For Fact-Checking Program,"Meta will close its fact-checking program across Facebook, Instagram and Threads on Monday, marking a major shift in the company's content moderation strategy.",https://dailycaller.com/2025/04/04/facebook-meta-mark-zuckerberg-fact-checking-program-end/,2025-04-04,"Meta will shutter its fact-checking program across Facebook, Instagram and Threads on Monday, marking a major shift in the company’s content moderation strategy.

The announcement follows a January pledge by CEO Mark Zuckerberg to dial back censorship and restore “free speech” on Meta-owned platforms. Going forward, Meta will adopt a system modeled after X’s “Community Notes,” allowing users to affix context to posts with no penalties or content suppression — effectively ending the era of third-party fact-checkers rating and flagging information. (RELATED: Zuckerberg’s Right-Wing Metamorphosis Still Has A Long Way To Go)

“By Monday afternoon, our fact-checking program in the US will be officially over,” Joel Kaplan, chief global affairs officer at Meta, wrote on X. “That means no new fact checks and no fact checkers. We announced in January we’d be winding down the program & removing penalties. In place of fact checks, the first Community Notes will start appearing gradually across Facebook, Threads & Instagram, with no penalties attached.”

By Monday afternoon, our fact-checking program in the US will be officially over. That means no new fact checks and no fact checkers. We announced in January we’d be winding down the program & removing penalties. In place of fact checks, the first Community Notes will start… — Joel Kaplan (@joel_kaplan) April 4, 2025

The program’s demise comes after mounting backlash from conservatives who long accused Meta’s third-party fact-checking partners — including groups like PolitiFact and Lead Stories — of ideological bias and collusion with government agencies to suppress dissenting views. While Meta maintains those fact checkers operated independently, critics pointed to repeated incidents involving censorship of stories related to COVID-19, Hunter Biden’s laptop and election integrity.

Zuckerberg’s move to replace the fact-checking framework with Community Notes signals a significant break from the previous model. Similar to X’s system, Meta’s new feature allows verified users to write “notes” adding context to posts, which are then rated for helpfulness by a broader pool of users. If deemed useful by ideologically diverse raters, the note is published.

“Changing the content filters to have to require higher confidence and precision is actually going to be the thing that reduces the vast majority of the censorship mistakes that we make,” Zuckerberg said in a January interview with Joe Rogan. “Removing the fact-checkers and replacing them with Community Notes is a good step forward — like, a very small percent of the content is fact-checked in the first place … I think it’ll be a positive step.”

Meta began testing Community Notes last month and says the tool will now begin “gradually” appearing across its major platforms — with no algorithmic throttling, takedowns or warnings attached.

Internationally, Meta will continue to rely on its existing framework of fact-checkers outside the U.S., according to its website.

"META Platforms, Facebook.","Google, X and Facebook Are Modern-Day Tobacco Companies","Just as tobacco companies knew they were poisoning people, today’s social media titans knowingly poison our politics, peddling lies and stoking angry divides for profit",https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/google-x-and-facebook-are-modern-day-tobacco-companies/,2025-04-04,"From Facebook to X to TikTok, today’s social media giants position themselves as bastions of free speech. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg now says fact-checking caused “too much censorship,” while TikTok brandishes a freedom-of-expression argument against its forced sale. Who, after all, could argue against the untrammeled freedom to speak?

The answer, it transpires, might be anyone paying attention. As we begin to understand the cataclysmic effect of viral misinformation flooding social media, the undeniable reality is that these media empires profiteer hugely from division and fear. In everything from politics to health, falsehoods propagated across social media cause immense harm. From 2018’s genocide against Myanmar’s Rohingya people, incited on Facebook, to X, Facebook and Telegram posts last year that sparked violent anti-immigrant riots in the U.K. to the people who gave 1.8 million views to a TikTok video that encouraged them to take bleach enemas to cure supposed parasite infestation, the evidence is clear that social media myths cause huge societal harm.

While Europe has moved to hold social media giants accountable, U.S. efforts have almost completely faltered, with YouTube, X and other platforms curtailing misinformation teams and allowing conspiracy theories to run riot. The industry’s now familiar attempts to deny responsibility for the harms of immensely lucrative products follows a familiar, deeply instructive playbook: the tobacco industry’s strategy of obstruction.

Just as four in 10 people were once smokers in the U.S., poisoning their lungs, vast numbers of people now get their news through the editorial prism of social media, poisoning their perceptions.

Around a fifth of Americans now get their news from social media influencers. A recent European survey of older teenagers and young adults found that 42 percent got their news mainly from social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. In the past two decades, social media giants have displaced traditional media as the news source for many, without the pesky issues of journalistic integrity or editorial responsibility. Instead they profit off engagement. And it is here that the corporate avarice and mendacity of the tobacco industry are especially illuminating.

Long before the overwhelming harms of smoking were widely known, tobacco companies already knew their product was harmful and addictive. Instead of taking corrective action, they spent decades undermining any regulation, even while cigarettes continued to kill millions. Opting not to mitigate harms but to instead distract from the overwhelming evidence their product was deadly, they aggressively pushed their product on vulnerable audiences. One now infamous leaked memo from a tobacco company in the 1960s bragged that “doubt is our product,” a means to distract from the harms of their profitable industry.

In the information age, social media companies are no different. From their own internal metrics, tech giants have long known what independent research now continuously validates: that the content that is most likely to go viral is that which induces strong feelings such as outrage and disgust, regardless of its underlying veracity. Moreover, they also know that such content is heavily engaged with and most profitable. Far from acting against false, harmful content, they placed profits above its staggering—and damaging—social impact to implicitly encourage it while downplaying the massive costs.

We’ve known this at least since the aftermath of the divisive 2016 American presidential election, where the culpability of social media for its signature triumph of fictions was greeted with what now looks like mock contrition. Tech giants such as Facebook even trumpeted their partnerships with fact-checking organizations.

This now rings insultingly hollow—in 2021 Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen revealed that the company, soon renamed Meta, did in fact have the tools to effectively halt the spread of dangerous disinformation on everything from politics to medicine. Yet its leaders chose to hobble those tools, precisely because they made more money off the high engagement that inflammatory fictions brought. (Asked about this criticism, a Meta spokesperson referred to an announcement made by Zuckerberg in January and the company’s policies on misinformation and “inauthentic behavior.”)

Social media titans embrace essentially the same hypocrisy the tobacco industry embodied when they feigned concern over harm reduction while covertly pushing their product ever more aggressively. With the reelection of Trump, our tech giants now no longer even pretend to care. They are pivoting instead to superficial celebrations of free speech. This was the rationale Zuckerberg adopted in when he said that Meta would cease fact-checking in his January announcement. Elon Musk meanwhile has labeled himself a “free-speech absolutist.” But between Zuckerberg’s Meta throwing a legal arsenal into silencing former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams’s damning insider account and Musk’s attempts to silence critics on X, as well as opposition protests in Türkiye, the hypocrisy is inescapable.

Platitudes about free expression betray a deliberate ignorance of human psychology. We tend to emote first and reason later, an observation that won psychologist Daniel Kahneman an economics Nobel in 2002. To take but one example, the riots that convulsed swatches of England and Northern Ireland last year were fueled by social media accounts claiming sickening crimes by immigrants, amplified by right-wing accounts. That these accounts were fictitious was no impediment to their ability to arouse fear and anger.

We have known for more than a decade that the ability to induces anger or disgust is a strong predictor of social media virality. This comes at a cost of veracity, as correctives to explosive fictions garner only fraction of the engagement. Even more concerning is the phenomenon of illusory truth, where repeated exposures to a falsehood prime us to accept it, even when we know it to be false on an intellectual level. For disinformation to do harm, it doesn’t even have to convince, it simply must induce doubt enough to render us unsure so that we sleepwalk into apathy. This underpins the extraordinary power of antivaccine propaganda, the major driver of vaccine hesitancy, where fear and doubt, induced by propaganda, can prompt concerned parents to delay or even refuse vaccination. Resistance to allowing vaccination has killed at least one child in Texas’s measles outbreak this year.

Social media companies know this. Engagement is their business model, and doubt about the harms they cause is their product. Tobacco executives, and their bought-off scientists, once proclaimed uncertainty over links between cigarettes and lung cancer. Zuckerberg has likewise testified to Congress, “The existing body of scientific work has not shown a causal link between using social media and young people having worse mental health, ” even while studies find self-harm, eating disorder and misogynistic material spreads on these platform unimpeded. This equivocation echoes protestations of tobacco companies that there was no causal evidence of smoking harms, even as incontrovertible evidence to the contrary rapidly amassed.

For all this, social media companies deserve opprobrium and ultimately regulation. Despite their protestations, they are not advocating free speech, only freedom from consequences for themselves. Until we start to think about how to mitigate the damage they wrack and begin placing societal trust over social media profits, tech billionaires will continue to exploit human misery and stoke our divisions to line their purses.

Here's what we know,Posts on Richardson's page were visible again days after she and many of her followers first said they disappeared.,https://www.snopes.com//news/2025/04/04/heather-cox-richardson-facebook/,2025-04-04,"On April 1, 2025, historian Heather Cox Richardson posted on Facebook that the social media platform had removed at least two of her posts from her page. In comments, followers said her posts dating from March 25 onward had also disappeared from their feeds.

Facebook users circulated a post from one of Richardson's followers that claimed an AI chatbot told them her posts were ""being deleted as part of a larger removal of online resources by the US government"" because they were ""related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).""

Posts dated March 25 to April 3 were visible on Richardson's profile at the time of this writing.

We were unable to determine whether Facebook intentionally removed or hid the posts and, if so, why. We've reached out to Facebook's parent company Meta as well as to Richardson, and will update this story if further information becomes available.

On April 1, 2025, Heather Cox Richardson, the author of the politically left-leaning Substack ""Letters from an American"" and a history professor at Boston College, posted (archived) on Facebook that the social media platform had removed at least two of her posts from her page.

Richardson wrote:

Hi Folks: my two posts from last night have disappeared for many of us, including me and Buddy, but appear to be here for others. I'm trying to figure it out but if anyone has any ideas, do let me know in the comments. Eager to see if this post shows up. H.

Commenters said posts had also disappeared from their feeds and Richardson's page when they tried to view them on their devices. Several commenters said the missing posts dated from March 25 onward.

Richardson also wrote (archived) about the posts on her Bluesky account, ""Facebook appears to be taking down my posts. ... I guess if I'm being banned I'm doing something right?""

Following Richardson's posts, Facebook users shared a separate post (archived) from a follower of Richardson's page who claimed to have asked ""Facebook AI"" — presumably Meta AI, a chatbot available through Facebook, Instagram and other apps from Facebook's parent company Meta — about the post removals.

The reader reported that the chatbot said Facebook was deleting Richardson's posts ""as part of a larger removal of online resources by the US government.""

At the time of this writing, Richardson's Facebook page showed posts daily from March 25 to April 3, 2025. Richardson's posts typically begin with the date of the previous day. This was also the case for the posts we viewed from March 25 to April 3, indicating that they were original postings as opposed to reposts of removed content.

We reached out to Richardson to ask exactly which posts were removed before she made her April 1 post as well as when she noticed the posts were missing and whether she had contacted Meta about their removal.

We also reached out to Meta for comment on whether the posts were removed from Facebook, and if so how and why, and await a reply.

Unfurling claims about the disappeared posts

The timeline for the alleged removal of Richardson's Facebook posts at the time of this writing was as follows:

April 1: Richardson said on Facebook that some of her posts had gone missing. Commenters agreed, some indicating the removal included posts dating back to March 25.

April 1-3: Facebook users began to circulate the copy-pasted text of a post from one of Richardson's followers, who claimed that ""Facebook AI"" said Richardson's posts were removed as part of government action to "" eliminate content related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, gender identity, and other topics.""

April 3: Richardson's Facebook page showed daily posts from March 15 to April 3.

The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, a tool used to archive webpages at moments in time, did not have any functional snapshots of Richardson's Facebook page between March 26 and April 3, 2025. As a result, we were unable to compare versions captured on different days to confirm whether any published posts were missing during the period in question.

The copy-pasted Facebook post with the ""Facebook AI"" response read as follows (our emphasis):

So a page I read from a historian is now suddenly getting daily posts deleted . When I asked AI Facebook why this was their response . This is kind of scary. Social media is being deleted if Viewpoints differs..... So much for free speech. Note she does not work for the federal government nor is she a part of a federal agency. Heather Cox Richardson posts are being deleted as part of a larger removal of online resources by the US government. This removal is in compliance with executive orders from President Donald Trump's administration, which aim to eliminate content related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, gender identity, and other topics ¹. Richardson, a historian and professor, is known for her newsletters and social media posts that provide historical context to current events. Her work often touches on topics like democracy, equality, and social justice, which might be affected by the executive orders ². The removed content includes over 8,000 web pages and approximately 3,000 datasets across various federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Census Bureau, and the Department of Justice ¹.

By the time of this writing, the Facebook user who appeared to have first posted the text updated the post to note that Richardson's posts ""were returned.""

In an attempt to reproduce the ""Facebook AI"" response from the copy-pasted posts stating the ""government"" removed Richardson's posts, we also asked the Meta AI chatbot about the alleged removal. However, we were unsuccessful in replicating the response that appeared in that post.

We tried two prompts on Meta AI: ""Why were Heather Cox Richardson's Facebook posts deleted?"" and ""Did the government delete Heather Cox Richardson's Facebook posts?"" Neither produced the answer from the April 1 Facebook post.

(Meta AI)

The answers we received were:

Q: Why were Heather Cox Richardson's Facebook posts deleted? A: Heather Cox Richardson's Facebook posts were deleted due to Facebook's algorithm flagging her content. According to reports, Facebook appears to be hiding or deleting her posts, which has been confirmed by Richardson herself. This issue has sparked concerns about censorship and the arbitrary application of Facebook's community standards. Richardson's followers have also reported difficulty in viewing and sharing her content, further fueling the controversy. Q: Did the government delete Heather Cox Richardson's Facebook posts? A: There's no evidence to suggest that the government deleted Heather Cox Richardson's Facebook posts. According to Richardson herself, Facebook appears to be removing her posts, including two recent ones critical of the Trump regime. This issue has raised concerns about censorship and Facebook's content moderation policies, but there's no indication of government involvement.

It's worth noting that AI chatbots like Meta AI or the popular ChatGPT don't always give the same answers to the same questions asked at different times, even when the wording is identical. In this case, we didn't know what the writer of the original Facebook post had asked Meta AI to generate their response so we guessed at likely prompts, even leading Meta AI on with a second question exclusively about the possibility of government involvement.

Social media platforms remain rulers of content visibility

Richardson herself suggested on Bluesky that Facebook was banning her page.

Facebook removes posts for various reasons outlined in its Community Standards. None of its standards are overtly related to politics, a running theme in Richardson's posts, but do include things such as ""hateful conduct"" and ""misinformation."" A page on Facebook's Help Center notes that it uses both human teams and automated technology to review content to ensure that it adheres to Community Standards.

Users can dispute the removal of content that Facebook takes down through a review process. It was unclear at the time of this writing whether Richardson had restored her posts through review.

Facebook itself has had a back-and-forth approach to political content on its platform. In September 2024, Meta rolled out a ""Political Content"" setting on Facebook, allowing users to opt to see less political content in their feeds.

This feature was the result of work started in 2021 to reduce political content for people who did not wish to see it.

Then, in January 2025, Meta announced it was phasing ""civic content,"" described as ""posts about elections, politics or social issues,"" back into users' feeds by ""treating civic content from people and Pages you follow on Facebook more like any other content in your feed."" This was part of Facebook's commitment to free speech, Meta said in a news release.

It was unclear how Meta's policies on political content could have affected the visibility of Richardson's generally politically left-leaning posts.

Another, more secretive way social media users and digital rights organizations suggest posts could disappear from followers' views is shadow banning, a practice in which platforms hide a user's posts from viewers but do not prevent that user from posting.

Though the practice of shadow banning is a common topic of discussion among social media users, large social media platforms like Instagram , which is also part of Meta, and TikTok have generally (archived) denied using it.

Facebook has never officially confirmed whether it uses shadow banning practices. Richardson did not publicly theorize that Facebook had shadow-banned her account.

In conclusion, without input from Meta or Richardson, it's hard to know exactly what, if anything, happened to Richardson's posts.

It was not possible to show through archived website snapshots that posts had indeed gone missing from Richardson's page. Richardson did not return a request for comment about whether she was told the reason for the alleged takedowns, and she did not comment on the issue publicly other than to say that posts had disappeared. We will update this piece with any relevant information.

The world's 10 richest people had a combined $172 billion wiped off their fortunes during the stock market's three-day rout, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.

President Donald Trump's unveiling of sweeping tariffs last Wednesday triggered a frantic sell-off that sent the S&P 500 down 11% over the course of Thursday, Friday, and Monday.

The world's 10 wealthiest people, collectively worth just over $2 trillion at the start of this year, have had more than $350 billion vaporized in 2025 due to the slide in the value of their equity stakes.

Elon Musk alone has shed $135 billion, bringing the Tesla and SpaceX CEO's net worth below $300 billion for the first time in five months. The only top 10 member in the green this year is Warren Buffett, the legendary investor who leads Berkshire Hathaway.

Here's where their fortunes stood at Monday's market close:

The UFC says it’s set to leverage Meta’s “leading technologies to deliver unprecedented engagement with hundreds of millions of UFC fans around the world,” which includes Meta AI, Meta Glasses, Meta Quest, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.

Additionally, the UFC says Meta will become its ‘Official AI Glasses Partner’, and will “work with UFC to creatively use their groundbreaking AI glasses in compelling ways at UFC events.”

“I’ve had a lot of great partners over the years that have helped us grow this sport, but Mark and his team at Meta are going to do things that will blow away UFC fans,” said UFC President and CEO Dana White. “Meta has the greatest minds in tech and they are going to take fan engagement to the next level. We’ve already started to work on some innovations with Meta around a new fighter rankings system that I’ll be sharing soon. The next few years will be an absolute game changer for fans of this sport.”

The matchup makes a good deal of sense, as Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has become a fan of the sport over the years, even engaging in a number of Jiu Jitsu competitions.

“I love this sport and I’m looking forward to working with the UFC to let fans experience it in new ways,” said Zuckerberg.

White also joined Meta’s board of directors in January alongside John Elkann, CEO of investment firm Exor, and tech investor Charlie Songhurst.

In terms of what it brings to Quest, the details are still thin. While not specific to XR as such, Meta says it’s slated to integrate UFC assets “with extensive activations in all Pay-Per-Views and Fight Nights, including brand placement in the world-famous Octagon, numerous broadcast features, and creative in-arena fan experiences.”

The deal is also set to include Meta’s social platform Threads featuring exclusive original UFC content.

In 2022, the UFC first partnered with Meta to bring 180-degree Fight Pass livestreams to Horizon Worlds, Quest’s social VR platform, as well as the Xtadium app. With the new partnership, it’s possible the two are looking to expand and evolve licensing across Quest, which could give UFC matches even greater visibility on the platform.

The companies say more details about the partnership are slated to arrive soon.",0.9953,0.018,0.835,0.147
"META Platforms, Facebook.",Phishers are increasingly impersonating electronic toll collection companies,"Steam was the most imitated brands by phishers in the first quarter of 2025, followed by Microsoft and Facebook/Meta, Guardio researchers have revealed. “Historically, the #1 spot has been dominated by the usual suspects – big tech companies like Meta, Micros…",https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/04/03/electronic-toll-collection-phishing/,2025-04-03,"Steam was the most imitated brands by phishers in the first quarter of 2025, followed by Microsoft and Facebook/Meta, Guardio researchers have revealed.

“Historically, the #1 spot has been dominated by the usual suspects – big tech companies like Meta, Microsoft, or even USPS. But this quarter, it’s Steam, and by a significant margin. Scammers have been targeting the massive gaming community by impersonating Steam to warn users about supposed account issues, like payment failures or suspicious login attempts. These fake messages are designed to trick victims into entering their login credentials on counterfeit websites, which then steal their account information,” the researchers noted.

“If you get an unexpected email or text about your Steam account or a supposed gift card reward, always double-check the URL and resist clicking on any links until you’re absolutely sure it’s legitimate.”

Electronic toll collection-related phishing surges

The top 10 most imitated brands in Q1 2025 were, according to the company:

1. Steam (digital game distribution service by Valve)

2. Microsoft

3. Facebook/Meta

4. Roblox (online game platform and game creation system)

5. SunPass (electronic toll collection company)

6. E-ZPass (electronic toll collection company)

7. USPS (US Postal Service)

8. EZDrive Massachusetts (electronic toll collection company)

9. Netflix (streaming service)

10. WeTransfer (file transfer service)

The most interesting thing here is that three separate US electronic toll collection companies made it into the list.

“Scammers have been sending out text messages claiming you have an unpaid toll fee, directing victims to fake websites designed to steal sensitive information. Guardio detected a staggering 604% increase in toll fee scam texts since the start of the year, with March seeing a 98% jump in scam activity from the previous week alone,” the researchers said.

This surge is most likely related to the popularity of phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platforms like Darcula and Lucid, which include phishing templates designed to impersonate postal services, courier companies, road toll systems, and tax refund agencies around the world and allow users to easily generate a phishing kit for any brand.

“The [Lucid] platform employs an automated attack delivery mechanism, deploying customizable phishing websites distributed primarily through SMS-based lures. To enhance effectiveness, Lucid leverages Apple iMessage and Android’s RCS technology, bypassing traditional SMS spam filters and significantly increasing delivery and success rates,” Prodaft researchers recently explained.

Another interesting trend is phishers impersonating popular fashion brands that announced store closures: Forever 21 (after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2025) and JOANN (in February 2025, after the company failed to obtain a buyer).

“Knowing shoppers are familiar with ‘going out of business’ sales, they created fake ads and websites to lure people into entering payment information for goods that will never arrive,” Guardio researchers noted.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Australia’s Leader Takes On Social Media. Can He Win?,Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has plenty of reasons to ban social media for under-16s.,https://time.com/7273443/australia-social-media-ban-anthony-albanese/,2025-04-03,"The press conference starts like any other: Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is grilled on everything from affordable housing and war in the Middle East to his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump. Then, Lana, 11, picks up the microphone. “Do you think social media has an impact on kids?” asks the suburban Canberra primary-school student. Of all the burning issues of the day, it’s the one that Albanese feels on surest ground to answer. It also goes to the heart of his government’s most eye-catching policy—one that directly affects Lana and the other student reporters invited to interrogate Australia’s top politician for Behind the News, a long-running kids’ current-affairs show.

“It certainly does, and that’s why we’re going to ban social media for under-16s,” Albanese replies resolutely. “I want to see you all out playing with each other at lunchtime, talking to each other like we are now, and engaging with each other … rather than just being on your devices.” The fact that Australia’s Prime Minister carved out 45 minutes between parliamentary sessions to indulge kids at least two terms from voting age underlines his belief that social media represents an unambiguous threat to his nation’s most precious resource: its children. And he is determined to do something about it.

Albanese answers questions from students from St. Francis of Assisi Primary School in Canberra on Feb. 5. Chris Gurney for TIME

The perils are largely beyond dispute. Some of the world’s biggest companies use the fig leaf of “engagement” to hook children during vulnerable developmental stages, rewiring their brains via a firehose of addictive content that psychologists say has changed human development on a previously unfathomable scale. In the decade that followed the proliferation of mobile internet services in 2010, depression among young Americans rose around 150%, with corresponding spikes in anxiety and self-harm. The trend is mirrored across the developed world, including Australia, where mental health hospitalizations soared 81% for teen girls and 51% for boys over the same period. “It has become the No. 1 issue that parents are talking about,” says Albanese. “These are developing minds, and young people need the space to be able to grow up.” On Dec. 10, in a bid to carve out and ring-fence that space, Australia will implement a 16-year-old age limit for users of platforms such as Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X. The law is the first of its kind in the world.

While most platforms have a self-imposed age limit of 13, enforcement is laughable; kids can simply input a false date of birth. Rather than targeting underage kids, the Australian law will punish companies that fail to introduce adequate safeguards with fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($31 million) for as yet undefined “systemic breaches.” (The precise details of how and when these fines will be imposed have yet to be made clear.) In other words, Australia will flip the equation: instead of relying on users to truthfully disclose their ages, it will put the burden on the world’s tech giants.

It’s a bold move, directly targeting some of the world’s most influential companies run by its richest and most powerful men, including X owner Elon Musk—who has dubbed the Albanese government “fascists” and the age restriction “a backdoor way to control access to the internet by all Australians.”

For its proponents, however, the law is a critical first step toward checking social media’s toxic influence on children.

In November, France’s Education Minister said the E.U. should “urgently” follow Australia’s example—not least since the infusion of artificial intelligence means that supercharged algorithms are peddling disinformation faster than ever. “The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit,” former U.S. President Joe Biden lamented in his farewell address. The upshot: Australia has now come to serve as a beachhead for others to prepare their own defenses. The U.K., Ireland, Singapore, Japan, and the E.U. are among many jurisdictions closely monitoring Canberra’s next move. In the U.S., the bipartisan Kids Off Social Media Act (KOSMA) to restrict social media for kids under 13 and bar platforms from pushing targeted content to users under 17 is advancing through the Senate, while around half of states passed legislation last year to make it harder for children and teens to spend time online without supervision. On March 5, Utah became the first state to require app stores to verify users’ ages and get parental consent for minors to download apps.

“If the age restriction goes well in Australia, then I think it will go global very quickly,” says Professor Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at New York University’s Stern School of Business and author of The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness. Albanese’s stance is also remarkable for just how politically uncontroversial it has proved. As Australia heads for a close federal election in May, Albanese’s center-left Labour Party and the right-leaning Liberal-National Coalition opposition are locking horns on every issue, whether nuclear energy, health care funding, or taxation. But the social media age restriction passed with bipartisan support and stands to be implemented no matter who triumphs at the ballot box. That’s not to say there aren’t detractors—and not just the social media companies, which say the legislation passed without due consultation. “We are concerned the government’s rapid, closed-door consultation process on the minimum-age law is undermining necessary discourse,” a Meta spokesperson told TIME. TikTok complained that an exemption for YouTube was “akin to banning the sale of soft drinks to minors but exempting Coca-Cola.”

Some mental health experts, meanwhile, say blocking kids from social media will drive them to darker, less regulated corners of the internet. Others fear children who bypass the age restriction will find themselves in a less controlled space where they’re unable to seek help. There’s also huge debate over what exactly counts as social media when myriad gaming and educational websites also employ addictive scrolling features. A group of 140 mental health experts penned an open letter to the Albanese government to oppose the ban, calling it “too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.” For Albanese, an imperfect plan is better than no plan at all. “We acknowledge that this won’t be absolute,” Albanese tells TIME during an exclusive interview in his parliamentary office in February. “But it does send a message about what society thinks and will empower parents to have those conversations with their children.”

They are children whose upbringing is unrecognizable from that of any previous generation. If parents once fretted about the attention kids paid to comic books and television, the immersive, dopamine-driven pull of the computer screen—video games, chat platforms, social media—has changed how nearly everyone looks at the world, but especially young people. A February government report by Australia’s eSafety Commissioner found that 80% of preteens used social media. A 2024 Pew Research poll found 46% of American teens said they were online “almost constantly.” Nearly a quarter of U.K. 5-to-7-year-olds now have their own smartphone. The devices can bring physical danger. Pedophiles and traffickers stalk the virtual world with greater freedom than in the real one. In 2023, the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) tracked 298 attempted abductions involving 381 children and received 36.2 million reports of suspected child sexual exploitation online.

But concern also wells around a child alone with a phone. For Albanese, there’s something especially sad about Australian kids shunning some of the world’s highest rates of sunshine for the artificial glare of screens. His own childhood in a one-parent household in Sydney’s industrial inner-city suburb of Camperdown was far from idyllic. His mother was crippled by chronic rheumatoid arthritis, meaning the family survived on her disability payments and his grandmother’s pension. Home was a government-housing block flanked by a children’s hospital, biscuit factory, and metal foundry. But there was a grassy patch where kids would hang around playing rugby, cricket, or swapping football cards. “We would go out to play at 9 o’clock and just knew you had to be home for lunch, and then do the same in the afternoon,” Albanese recalls. “People interacted with each other. And that capacity to communicate face-to-face is really important. They learn how to win, how to lose, how to engage.”

It may sound wistful, but Albanese’s perspective is backed by science. Psychologists say physical play, preferably outdoors and among a mix of ages, is essential to a child’s development. Young people learn how to not get hurt by negotiating scenarios in which getting hurt is possible, such as climbing a tree or leaping from a swing at its zenith. But such play is increasingly a thing of the past. Instead, time on screens has grown and grown, turbo-charged in 2009 with the arrival of the “like” button on Facebook and “retweet” on Twitter, now X—innovations that, in the minds of many experts, transformed social media from a harmless friendship forum to an algorithm-driven popularity contest. Instagram debuted a year later, coinciding with the launch of the iPhone 4 and Samsung Galaxy S, both of which featured the world’s first front-facing cameras. Instagram’s array of filters allowed users to make images less natural and more stylized and are now ubiquitous across Snapchat, TikTok, and other platforms.

The result has been a great deal of diversion, not all of it positive. The digital realm brings striking new elements of risk, for instance, to young people’s emerging sexuality, from the distorting effect of readily available hardcore pornography on all who see it (the term incel, or involuntarily celibate, was coined for frustrated, often misogynistic young men who bond online), as well as a heightened risk of online grooming and sextortion. In July 2022, 17-year-old Rohan Patrick Cosgriff died by suicide near his home outside Melbourne after he was pressured into sending an intimate picture to someone called “Christine” on Snapchat, who then demanded money not to distribute the images. A note in Cosgriff’s pocket simply said: “I made a huge mistake. I’m sorry.” The Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation received over 58,000 reports of online child abuse in 2023–24, a 45% year-on-year rise. Australia is far from unique; the NCMEC, in the U.S., saw a rise of over 300% in reports of online enticement including sextortion from 2021 to 2023.

For girls, social media takes a different role—one that statistics show can prove even more damaging. Whereas male social hierarchy has traditionally adhered to physical attributes like sporting prowess, girls find value in the breadth and depth of relationships. In short, popularity. And one way to climb the social ziggurat is to undermine your peers: spread gossip, turn friends against rivals, and lower others’ value within the group. Read More: ‘We’re In a New World’: American Teenagers on Mental Health and How to Cope But the explosion of front-facing cameras and filters has meant the reflection teens see in the mirror has become less and less attractive compared with the carefully curated photos and videos of their peers online, causing self-worth to plunge. “Girls seeing lots of beautiful pictures of other girls living perfect lives is absolutely devastating to them,” says Haidt. Those with poor self-worth are likelier to lash out at others, with “indirect” bullying more prevalent among adolescent girls than boys.

One of the first things that Kelly O’Brien saw upon entering 12-year-old Charlotte’s bedroom on Sept. 9 was her cell phone on the floor. Then she noticed two pillows neatly arranged under the duvet. By the time she found her daughter in the en suite bathroom it was too late. When the paramedics arrived, “they just looked at her and said, ‘So sorry, she’s gone,’” says O’Brien, eyes brimming. Kelly believes Charlotte took her own life at their suburban Sydney home in large part because of the toxic effect of social media. Charlotte was a bright girl who loved cheerleading, doted on her baby brother, and was navigating the tricky road from childhood to adulthood, equally obsessed with Taylor Swift and Gossip Girl as well as the latest Disney animation. Charlotte had suffered bullying at school, but her parents say it was social media that rendered that cycle of acceptance and rejection unbearably acute. “The weeks that she was in, she was over the moon,” says Mat O’Brien, Charlotte’s dad. “The week she was out, just awful.”

As soon as Charlotte got a cell phone it became a problem, spurring reclusive, depressive episodes. Charlotte had her phone confiscated more often than she had access, Kelly says, a punishment that invariably began with two days of sullen withdrawal followed by a marked upturn in mood—classic addiction symptoms, say psychologists. The night before her passing, Charlotte had been upbeat, enjoying her favorite pasta dinner and baking banana bread for the next day. “I kissed the happiest girl in the world good night,” says Kelly. Something happened after she got to her room. A friend who spoke to a distraught Charlotte later that evening has since told Kelly about the vile, hateful message her daughter received via Snapchat. (“We are deeply committed to keeping our community safe,” a Snap spokesperson told TIME. “Our hearts go out to this family, whose pain is unimaginable.”) Social media companies say that bullying has always been a problem and will continue whether via schoolyard taunts, crank phone calls, or their platforms. Still, beginning in the early 2010s, girls’ mental health was hit by a sharp rise in rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm. The rate of self-harm for young adolescent girls in the U.S. nearly tripled from 2010 to 2020, while the rate for older teens doubled. In 2020, 1 out of every 4 American teen girls had experienced a major depressive episode in the previous year.

Kelly O’Brien explained the devastating effects of social media on Charlotte in a letter to Albanese as part of the 36 Months campaign—a grassroots movement to raise and properly enforce the age limit for social media to 16. “When you hear firsthand about a parent losing their child then it undoubtedly has an impact,” says Albanese, who later invited the O’Briens to meet with him in Canberra. Also at that meeting was Michael Wipfli, an Australian radio presenter known as “Wippa,” who spearheaded 36 Months. “Sat in the Prime Minister’s office, it was clear he knew what needed to be done,” says Wippa. “We needed leadership, a captain’s call, somebody to say, ‘enough is enough.’”

Albanese first became involved in leftist politics while studying economics at the University of Sydney. He rose up the Labour Party ranks with a reputation as a backroom mediator and a knack for forging concord between squabbling factions. After Labour’s shock defeat in Australia’s 2019 federal election, Albanese emerged as an unexpected but unifying leadership candidate. “He’s an accidental Prime Minister,” says Nick Bisley, dean of social sciences at La Trobe University. Indeed, Albanese has struggled to unify an ever more polarized country—despite an undeniable everyman charisma. As Albanese inspected repairs to a bridge destroyed by floodwater in northern Queensland, he was joined by the mayor of the cut-off town of Ingham, population 4,455, who arrived wearing shorts, a faded polo shirt, thong sandals, and a cap advertising the local tractor mechanic. “You didn’t have to dress up!” teased a local lawmaker as helicopters carrying supplies buzzed overhead. “Anthony’s an ordinary bloke!”

It’s a pit stop that showcases Australia’s endearing insouciance as well as how vital internet access has become for communications across its vast expanse—not least as climate change renders extreme weather more frequent and severe. Australia is the world’s sixth largest country by landmass—roughly equivalent to the U.S. minus Alaska—though 55th by population with just 26 million people. The result is an abundance of sparsely inhabited outback communities for which social media is “absolutely critical,” admits Albanese. “We’re not Luddites,” he adds, reeling off the various platforms he posts on. “Young people aren’t being banned from a range of interactions through technology that are about their education or engaging with each other. We’re not confiscating people’s devices.”

Albanese points to the success of last year’s ban of cell phones in Australian public schools. “The impact has been phenomenal,” says Australian Education Minister Jason Clare. A survey of almost 1,000 school principals in Australia’s most populous state of New South Wales shows 87% say students are less distracted in the classroom while 81% have noticed improved learning. Meanwhile, South Australia has seen a 63% decline in critical incidents—such as bullying and distribution of explicit or derogatory content—involving social media and 54% fewer behavioral issues. “But when school ends the phones come out and they’re back in the cesspit of social media,” says Clare. “In the old days, bullying and intimidation stopped at the school gate. Now it’s at home as well.” Read More: For Teens, Saving Each Other From Social Media Is a Team Effort Still, critics say the social media age restriction was a knee-jerk reaction passed without proper consultation, involves thorny data-privacy issues, and creates even more risks for youngsters who use platforms illicitly. “It’s absolutely dumb, it’s not going to work,” says Roy Sugarman, a Sydney-based clinical psychologist. “It’s ridiculous because the genie is out of the bottle.”

Sugarman compares the Australian ban to American Prohibition in the 1920s, which some studies suggest actually increased alcohol consumption in the U.S. while leading to a spike in organized crime. He says a far better tactic would be to teach teens to be technologically astute, to understand online dangers, how to think rationally, act with purpose, and deal with the virtual world to mitigate damages. “Human behavior doesn’t lend itself to being told what to do,” says Sugarman. “It’s the opposite. Humans hate being told what to do.” History also offers examples that point the other way. While Sugarman invokes the example of Prohibition, Wippa compares social media age restrictions to similar rules for cigarettes, which while routinely flouted have led smoking rates among young people to plummet. But the fact is, nobody knows what will happen. Nothing like this has been attempted before. And then there’s the question of implementation. Australia’s eSafety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, says that around 30 different age-verification technologies are being tested in collaboration with various social media platforms, including French firm BorderAge, which claims to accurately gauge age using AI analysis of hand signals. Meanwhile, platforms, which the legislation makes responsible for enforcing the age restrictions, want to pass that burden to app stores, principally run by Apple and Google, saying they should act as gatekeepers.

Grant compares the legislation to laws regarding fencing swimming pools. In the early 1970s, the widespread availability of cheap, preformed fiberglass pools meant the rate of young children drowning soared. Not long after, states began requiring all private swimming pools to be fenced, which led deaths to fall and has since been adopted nationwide. But that didn’t mean Australia suddenly stopped teaching kids to swim, fired all the lifeguards, or fenced off the ocean. “This is not the great Australian firewall,” says Grant. “Children’s social media accounts aren’t going to magically disappear. But we can make things a lot better for parents and a lot better for kids.” Grant speaks with the zeal of a convert. After cutting her teeth as a congressional staffer focused on tech issues in the 1990s, the Seattle native worked 17 years at Microsoft, two years at Twitter, and a year at Adobe, before being tapped for her current post (the first e-Safety Commissioner anywhere in the world). She believes, from her inside knowledge of the tech industry, that the big players will always put profit first. “They can target you with advertising with deadly precision,” she says. “They could use the same technologies to be able to identify hateful content and child sexual abuse material.”

Recent events have cemented her skepticism. Last April, Grant sued X over its refusal to remove videos of a religiously motivated stabbing of a bishop in a Sydney church that sparked rioting. X eventually geofenced it so it wasn’t available in Australia, while Musk hit out at Grant as “censorship commissar,” leading to a raft of online abuse. “I still receive death threats,” she tells TIME. But even more painful for Grant is the knowledge that 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana watched that same Sydney church attack video on X just six minutes before leaving home with a knife to murder three young children and injure 10 others in the U.K. town of Southport on July 29. “Having gratuitous violence of terrorist events freely available normalizes it, desensitizes it,” says Grant, “and in the worst cases [it] radicalizes and spills over into real-world harm.”

The spat between Grant and Musk prompted Albanese to label the tech mogul an “arrogant billionaire.” But asked by TIME whether he’s concerned by Musk’s burgeoning influence as Trump’s consigliere, Albanese demurs, instead decrying how misinformation can erode trust in institutions. “People have conflict fatigue,” he says. “People need to have respectful debate. And I think there is a concern in society that some of that is breaking down.”

Albanese’s squirming is understandable. Australia and the U.S. are close allies linked via the Quad and AUKUS military arrangements. But Trump spent his first term taking aim at historic alliances, accusing South Korea and Japan of not paying their fair share for American security guarantees, and his return to the White House has heralded a full-frontal assault on European democracies. Australia is one of the few close American allies with a trade deficit with the U.S.—“since Truman!” Albanese stresses—as well as a record of deploying alongside American forces and standing up to Beijing. In 2023, Canberra also agreed to invest $3 billion into U.S. shipyards. However, the White House has already hiked tariffs on Australian exports of aluminum and steel, while Albanese’s plan to force tech companies like Google and Meta to pay for news shared on their platforms was recently labeled an “outrageous” attempt to “steal our tax revenues” by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro.

The social media age restriction is yet another friction point between Canberra and American Big Business. Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has called on the Trump Administration to help “push back on this global trend” of what he terms “censorship.” Then there’s Kevin Rudd, former Australian Prime Minister and current ambassador to the U.S., who was previously quoted calling Trump not only “the most destructive President in history” but also a “village idiot.” “The center-left of Australian politics is a long way from the MAGA world,” adds Bisley, of La Trobe University. “Australia’s welfare-state instincts are just not particularly aligned to the free-market capitalism of the U.S.” It’s friction that raises the question of whether Australia can even enforce social media age restrictions. While potential $31 million fines may seem eye-watering, that’s the top penalty for “systemic breaches”—rather than per offense, day, or child—and mere pocket change to someone like Meta’s Zuckerberg or X’s Musk, the world’s richest man, worth hundreds of billions and with an ideological antipathy to what he perceives as curbs on free speech. (X failed to respond to repeated requests for comment for this story.) Asked whether social media platforms could be banned outright for noncompliance with the new legislation, Australia’s Communications Minister Michelle Rowland replies, “That’s not a feature of the legislation.”

In the final analysis, it might not matter. For Mat and Kelly O’Brien, the social media age restriction at least takes the issue out of parents’ hands, just like for driving or drinking alcohol. Asked whether Charlotte would still be alive if the legislation had been in place last September, Kelly has no doubt. “Absolutely,” she says, “1,000%.” And while it might be too late to save Charlotte, they’re hopeful Albanese’s stand means other families might be spared similar heartache. “I feel like lesser men would have crumbled,” Kelly says. “But he stood up to Big Tech and the naysayers. I’m very grateful and proud.”

Trump Media and Technology Group stock dropped as much as 9% on the news, before paring back some of those losses. The stock, which has often been described as a meme stock, has shed 44% of its value since Jan. 1.

Trump Media on Tuesday filed to register up to 142.5 million shares and warrants for sale, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes 114.75 million shares of common stock held by Trump’s trust, which is controlled by Donald Trump, Jr., the president’s eldest son. Axios first reported on the filing.

The SEC will need to consider the filing effective before stockholders such as Trump’s trust and ARC Global, which sponsored Trump Media’s special-purpose acquisition company, can sell their shares.

Trump’s ownership of Trump Media, valued at roughly $2.1 billion, made him one of the world’s 500 richest people last year, with a fortune of as much as $6.5 billion. Forbes now estimates his fortune at about $4.7 billion.

In a statement, Trump Media denied that the filing indicates Trump’s trust or other insiders plan to sell their shares.

“To be clear, these shares were already registered last June on an S-1 form, and today TMTG submitted a routine filing that re-registers them on an S-3 form in order to keep the Company’s filings effective,” the company said. “In fact, there currently is no open window for any affiliate to sell shares.”

Last year, the president, amid speculation that he may sell his stake after a six-month lockup period ended, said he wouldn’t sell his stake in the company.

“The reason I built it is because I don’t want to have my voice shut down,” Trump said during a press conference at his golf course near Los Angeles in September. “A lot of people think that I will sell my shares, you know, they’re worth billions of dollars, but I don’t want to sell my shares. I don’t need money.”

The filing comes as another company that trades in politics, Newsmax, has a dizzying first week as a public company. The conservative television network’s stock has soared by more than 623% since it debuted on the New York Stock Exchange, making founder Christopher Ruddy a billionaire. The stock was down 45% in intraday trading Wednesday morning.

The amendments ban the placement of advertising on any blocked site in Russia, regardless of reason. Submitted in 2024, the bill will affect thousands of pirate sites and Russia's rapidly growing influencer market.

If people insist that most things on the internet must remain ‘free’, the mechanisms that allow that to happen must continue too.

Invariably that means more advertising alongside diminishing privacy, at least for those lucky enough to still have any left. Yet life could still be a lot worse, oddly enough by restrictions on advertising designed to hurt certain platforms while ensuring people are unable to profit from them.

Blocking Pirates, Blocking Extremists

For close to a decade-and-a-half, Russian ISPs have been required to block tens of thousands of pirate sites. It’s highly unlikely the work will end anytime soon, or anytime at all, especially since site-blocking is supported by almost constant legal amendments that continuously expand justification for blocking on all kinds of grounds.

Prominent examples can be found in Facebook and Instagram. Since sites linked to terrorists or extremists are prime targets for blocking, Russia labeled parent company Meta an extremist organization in 2022 and then blocked it using the same mechanisms deployed against pirate sites. In common with all blocking in Russia, blocking is not 100% effective, meaning that pirate and other blocked sites can be accessed without too much difficulty.

The same goes for Facebook and Instagram, but the stakes are significantly higher when banned social media platforms enter the equation. Figures released by telecoms watchdog Roskomnadzor late March claimed that between 2022 and 2024, Russians spent 13.6 billion rubles (US$161 million) advertising on banned sites.

Loved by Russia’s influencers, Instagram generated the most revenue (US$111.95m) followed by Elon Musk’s X (US$26.03m), and Facebook (US$23.91m).

Banning Advertising

With regular companies, entrepreneurs, influencers, and bloggers using banned VPNs to circumvent state blocking, something had to give. Russia frames this as “funding foreign extremist groups” using Russian money. The accused most likely see things differently; they’re working and putting food on the table, but how long that can continue is up for debate.

On March 25, the State Duma adopted amendments to federal laws “On Combating Extremist Activity” and “On Advertising.” The amendments introduce a ban on advertising on any platform designated as prohibited in Russia; i.e any sites blocked or restricted in Russia for any reason are affected by the same ban. An announcement on the website of the State Duma clarifies as follows:

The law establishes a ban on the distribution of advertising on the information resources of foreign or international organizations whose activities are recognized as undesirable on the territory of Russia, public or religious associations or other organizations in respect of which a court has made a decision that has entered into legal force on liquidation or prohibition, as well as on resources access to which is restricted in accordance with the law.

“Despite the fact that a number of social networks have been blocked in Russia, whose owners pursue an openly unfriendly policy towards our country, disseminate deliberately false information and values ​​alien to us, citizens and companies continue to use them to advertise their goods and services,” says State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin.

“Sometimes, without even thinking, they transfer money to those who deliberately harm our country.”

Penalties for Non-Compliance

Posting on Telegram, Russian attorney Ekaterina Abashina predicts the likely scale of the fines for non-compliance and warns that any existing campaigns should be shut down before it’s too late.

“Special fines for advertising on the other side of the block have not yet been introduced, so the general penalty for violating the basic requirements for advertising will be in effect – up to 500,000 rubles [US$5,900] (for legal entities) and up to 2,500 rubles [US$30.00] for individuals,” Abashina notes.

“From the non-obvious : after September 1, a fine may also fly for old advertising placements that continue being placed, so you can start auditing your ads now.”

How and when the authorities will choose to enforce their new powers remains to be seen. It seems unlikely that the thousands of pirate sites currently blocked will face any specific action, but if any stray beyond movies and TV shows into the political arena, that might not be especially smart under the circumstances.",-0.9968,0.131,0.82,0.05

The Ultimate Fighting Championship has signed a multi-year, multimillion-dollar partnership that'll leverage Meta's various technologies to help the mixed martial arts organization better connect with fans. The wide-ranging deal will involve Meta platforms and services including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads. The UFC will also have access to Meta Quest, Meta Glasses, and Meta AI, potentially paving the way for groundbreaking fan experiences.

Speaking of Threads, Meta's answer to X will now be the official social media partner of the UFC – so don't expect to see X messages featured on broadcasts any longer.

Meta, meanwhile, will receive favorable brand placement during PPV and Fight Night events in the octagon and be featured during broadcasts. Fans attending live events will also be able to take part in ""creative"" experiences, we're told.

The companies said additional elements of the partnership will be announced as the two sides work together on future innovations.

The partnership isn't entirely surprising considering the relationship between UFC President Dana White and Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg. In 2022, Zuckerberg started training in mixed martial arts and it wasn't long before we started seeing him sitting cageside at UFC events. He even appeared in the corner of Alexander Volkanovski at UFC 298 last year.

In mid-2023, a potential MMA bout between Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk was floated but nothing ever came of it. Given the current climate surrounding Musk, perhaps White should revisit the matchup? They'd sell a ton of pay per views. White joined Meta's board of directors in January.

The UFC was founded in 1993, with the original idea being for a tournament featuring various martial arts disciplines to see which was truly supreme. The promotion struggled mightily for years as critics deemed it too violent. US Senator John McCain famously described it as ""human cockfighting.""

White was brought on in the early 2000s and eventually righted the ship. In 2016, WME-IMG purchased UFC parent company Zuffa for $4.025 billion.

Some popular social media and internet stocks are now significantly lower than their ...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-pins-snap-social-media-115903221.html,2025-04-01,"Turning to Wall Street, META earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 44 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average analyst META stock price target of $763.34 implies a 32% upside potential from current levels.

Unlike the other stocks in this comparison, Meta is now a dividend stock after initiating a dividend in 2024. While its yield is just 0.35%, the company has already raised the payout from $0.50 a quarter in 2024 to $0.525 per quarter in 2025. It features a dividend coverage ratio of just 8.4%, meaning it has plenty of room to continue to raise dividends over time. These factors mean that Meta has strong potential as a dividend growth stock, especially as it grows earnings over time. In addition to paying a dividend, Meta also returns capital to shareholders via share repurchases, buying back a whopping $29.75 billion of shares in 2024.

As a company, Meta has fully matured yet continues to upscale. During Q4 2024, it posted 5% daily active user growth, which isn’t bad considering that 3.35 billion users, over 40% of the people on the planet, already use its products. Even better, the company grew revenue at an impressive 22% clip for the year, indicating that it is getting better at monetizing its massive user base.

With 3.35 billion people from all demographics using its platforms like Facebook and Instagram, Meta Platforms (META) is a social media dominator, but the market isn’t pricing it like one. Down more than 20% from its 52-week high, shares of Meta now trade for a very reasonable 22.8x consensus 2025 earnings estimates. This is only a small premium to the S&P 500 (SPX), which trades for 20.5x next year’s earnings. A slight premium to the broader market seems like a bargain for a company with Meta’s dominant market presence and history of strong performance.

Let’s examine these three social media stocks to determine which one is a compelling buy amid the current selloff.

Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks.

The ongoing market correction is hitting tech stocks particularly hard. Some popular social media and internet stocks are now significantly lower than their 52-week highs. Shares of Meta Platforms (META), the $1.5 trillion-dollar gorilla in the social media space, are down 22.2% from recent highs. Meanwhile, shares of other popular social media stocks like Pinterest (PINS) and Snapchat (SNAP) are down 30.4% and 48.7%, respectively.

Story Continues

I’m bullish on Meta based on its reasonable valuation, impressive revenue growth, small but growing dividend, share buybacks, and its perfect 10 Smart Score. Its Strong Buy consensus rating and average analyst price target, implying a potential upside of over 30%, illustrate the attractive opportunity here.

Pinterest (NYSE:PINS)

Though smaller than Meta, Pinterest (PINS) is another popular social media platform that now boasts 553 million monthly active users worldwide. Pinterest describes itself as “a visual search and discovery platform where people find inspiration, curate ideas, and shop products—all in a positive place online.” The visuals-focused social media company emphasizes the positive environment it maintains, which could be a differentiating factor going forward based on the polarized climate in day-to-day dialogue in the U.S. found on other popular platforms like X and Facebook.

Amid the ongoing market correction, Pinterest is down 30.5% from its 52-week high. Pinterest stock (PINS) is cheaper than Meta Platforms and more affordable than the S&P 500, trading at just 17x forward earnings estimates.

Moreover, Pinterest is showing strong revenue growth, growing revenue by 19% in 2024. The company recorded its first-ever billion-dollar quarter in revenue, bringing in $1.15 billion in Q4 2024, good for 18% year-over-year growth. While Pinterest doesn’t report daily active users like Meta, monthly active users grew by 11%.

Unlike Meta, Pinterest does not yet pay a dividend, but like Meta, it returns capital to shareholders via share repurchases. The company recently announced a $2 billion share repurchase program, which is a significant sum considering its market cap of just $21.3 billion.

Is PINS Stock a Good Buy?

Turning to Wall Street, PINS earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 26 Buys, six Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst PINS stock price target of $45.65 implies a 45% upside potential from current levels.

I’m bullish on Pinterest based on its attractive valuation, massive share buyback in relation to its market cap, and bright estimates on Wall Street indicating more than 40% upside later this year.

Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP)

Down nearly 50% from recent highs, Snapchat (SNAP) has been hit the hardest of all three of social media stocks in this comparison. Despite the drawdown, Snapchat is still more expensive than Meta and Pinterest based on 2025 earnings estimates. Analysts expect the stock to earn $0.36 per share this year, meaning the stock trades at 24.6x 2025 estimates, a slight premium to Meta and a significant premium to Pinterest.

Snapchat’s revenue grew by 16% for 2024, which isn’t bad. However, despite being a much larger company, Meta’s revenue growth was lower than Pinterest’s and slightly lower than Snapchat’s. On the positive side, Snaphat posted daily active user growth of 9% to 453 million during the most recent quarter.

Snapchat does not pay a dividend but does buy back shares and announced a $500 million share buyback program in Q4 2024. While this is decent for a company with a $15 billion market cap, Pinterest’s share repurchase program is much more significant.

Is SNAP a Buy or Sell?

Turning to Wall Street, SNAP earns a Hold consensus rating based on six Buys, 24 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average analyst SNAP stock price target of $13.19 implies a 48% upside potential from current levels.

While the nearly 50% upside implied by the analyst price target is tempting, the fact that the vast majority of analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and its mediocre Smart Score is concerning. I’m neutral on Snapchat based on these factors and its relatively high valuation despite its slower revenue growth compared to META and PINS.

Indomitable Social Media Uptrend

Taking it all in, I’m excited about the opportunities presented by both Meta Platforms and Pinterest but far less enthused about Snapchat. Snapchat isn’t a poor stock per see, but it’s hard to justify a premium when it’s growing slower than both Pinterest and Meta Platforms, especially when considering its significantly smaller size than Meta.

Performance comparison between Meta Platforms (META), Pinterest (PINS) and Snapchat (SNAP)

I am bullish on Meta based on its reasonable valuation, impressive revenue growth for a company of its massive scale, small but growing dividend, and share buyback program. Investors who cut through the noise of the current market selloff and invest in Meta will be rewarded over the long term.

Lastly, Pinterest is a bit more speculative than Meta, but I also find it to be an attractive stock opportunity. Its outperform-equivalent Smart Score on TipRanks, bullish consensus rating on Wall St., and average analyst price target implying an upside of over 45% all highlight the strong potential. I’m bullish on Pinterest based on its cheap valuation (the lowest in this group and significantly cheaper than the broader market), user and revenue growth, and massive stock buyback program.

The EU is expected to impose fines against the social media giant any day now, having preliminarily ruled in July 2024 that Facebook and Instagram’s “pay or consent” advertising model violates the bloc’s Digital Markets Act (DMA).

Under the DMA and Digital Services Act (DSA), the EU can financially penalize Meta up to ten percent of its annual revenue — $16 billion based on the company’s 2024 earnings — for failing to comply with regulatory requirements that Zuckerberg has accused of “institutionalizing censorship” across social media platforms. According to the Wall Street Journal, Meta is worried that the expected DMA ruling against Meta’s “pay or consent” model could impact its European revenue, which accounts for almost a quarter of its overall earnings, by forcing the company to allow European users to limit personalized ads on Facebook and Instagram for free.

Zuckerberg has already voiced his distaste for EU regulations, having called for Trump to prevent the EU from fining American tech companies over antitrust violations in January. The Wall Street Journal reports that Zuckerberg has also directed Meta executives in recent weeks to push US trade officials to help the company fight against the anticipated EU fine. Zuckerberg himself paid a visit to Washington in February to beg officials for help.

The EU is under pressure to scale back penalties against US tech companies or risk further retaliation atop of the tariffs that have already been threatened by the Trump administration. We’ll see how effective Zuck’s bootlicking has been when the EU renders its imminent decision.",-0.8074,0.085,0.854,0.061
"META Platforms, Facebook.","Sick of Musk and Zuckerberg, Gen Z is flocking to Tumblr","Sick of Musk and Zuckerberg, Zoomers have found a new place to network that millennials didn't already ruin: Tumblr.",https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-flocking-tumblr-millennials-musk-zuckerberg-safe-space-2025-4,2025-04-01,"Occupy Wall Street, Notorious RBG, cottagecore. These and several other lasting internet trends and IRL movements of the 2010s were born not on Twitter, on Facebook, or in the mainstream media but on Tumblr . You might remember it as the blogging platform that became one of the most hyped startups in the world before fading into obsolescence — bought by Yahoo for $1.1 billion in 2013 (back when a billion still felt like a billion), then acquired by Verizon, and later offloaded for fractions of pennies on the dollar in a distressed sale. That same Tumblr, a relic of many millennials' formative years, has been having a moment among Gen Z.

Zoomers have gravitated toward the pseudonymous platform, viewing it as a safe space as the rest of the social internet has become increasingly commodified, polarized, and dominated by lifestyle influencers . As in its heyday, Tumblr is still more about sharing art, culture, and fandom than individual status. More posts about anime and punk rock than bridal trends and politics. In 2025, 50% of Tumblr's active monthly users are Gen Zers, as are 60% of new users signing up, according to data Tumblr shared with Business Insider. And several of Zoomers' icons, from the ""Fault in Our Stars"" author John Green to the pop superstar Halsey, have come back to the platform.

""Gen Z has this romanticism of the early-2000s internet,"" says Amanda Brennan, an internet librarian who worked at Tumblr for seven years, leaving her role as head of content in 2021. She still uses her own Tumblr regularly as the internet's resident meme librarian . ""It allows for experimentation that's not tied to your face.""

Part of the reason young people are hanging out on old social platforms is that there's nowhere new to go. The tech industry is evolving at a slower pace than it was in the 2000s, and there's less room for disruption. Big Tech has a stranglehold on how we socialize. That leaves Gen Z to pick up the scraps left by the early online millennials and attempt to craft them into something relevant. They love Pinterest (founded in 2010) and Snapchat (2011), and they're trying out digital point-and-shoot cameras and flip phones for an early-2000s aesthetic — and learning the valuable lesson that sometimes we look better when blurrier. More Gen Zers and millennials are signing up for Yahoo . Napster , surprising many people with its continued existence, just sold for $207 million. The trend is fueled by nostalgia for Y2K aesthetics and a longing for a time when people could make mistakes on the internet and move past them.

The pandemic also brought more Gen Z users to Tumblr. The blogging site was an online oasis in the barrage of horrifying news and conspiracy theories, thanks to its acute focus on art and pop culture. And when other platforms take hits, Tumblr benefits: User numbers spiked to coincide with the near-banning of TikTok in January and the temporary ban of X in Brazil last year. Tumblr seems to be a refuge for people searching for new social sites. In January, people launched communities on Tumblr to post and preserve their favorite TikTok videos. Meanwhile, progressives mad at Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk for going full MAGA and are ditching Facebook and X as punishment.

Tumblr's ""blessing for it as a user is a curse for it as a business,"" says Amanda Brennan, Tumblr's former head of content.

""Our menu has been full. There's been no more space to add something else,"" says Andrew Roth, the 26-year-old founder and CEO of the Gen Z-focused research and consulting firm DCDX. In a poll of more than 600 Zoomers that DCDX conducted in 2024, two-thirds of respondents said they wanted their social media presence to become more private. Tumblr might be just what many young people are looking for. ""Now the time feels more ripe for that to happen for Tumblr, even if Tumblr is doing the same thing or staying in the same spot.""

Ari Levine, the head of brand partnerships at Tumblr, tells me the platform is both ""more peaceful"" and more resolutely itself than its competitors. While Meta runs around aping its competitors' features (reels from TikTok, stories from Snapchat), it hasn't been able to mimic what Tumblr does (though Meta, then called Facebook, was in talks to buy Tumblr before Yahoo did). ""How many times am I in an app and I no longer know what app I'm in?"" Levine says.

And Tumblr still works much like an older internet, where people have more control over what they see and rely less on algorithms. ""You curate your own stuff; it takes a little bit of work to put everything in place, but when it's working, you see the content you want to see,"" Fjodor Everaerts, a 26-year-old in Belgium who has made some 250,000 posts since he joined Tumblr when he was 14. He says he sees his blog as a ""flow of consciousness"" and a ""diary,"" one that's mostly made up of reblogging things he finds interesting rather than original posts. In a way, that's a core part of what Tumblr has always done: It's far more focused on fandom and art than it is around single blogs becoming cults of personality.

Being an iconic and beloved cultural corner doesn't always lead to cash flows, however, and the site has had a troubled decade. Yahoo bought Tumblr when Tumblr was one of the world's fastest-growing social networks, and it promised not to ""screw it up."" But Tumblr's embedded anti-advertising and anti-influencer stances had driven a wedge between the site and monetization. The pseudonymous nature of Tumblr was a direct opposition to Facebook's insistence on users using their real names and faces, and the free-flowing adult content on the site scared advertisers off. Yahoo got left behind in the mobile revolution, and Tumblr, too, suffered, with Verizon scooping up both at discount. In 2018, Tumblr notoriously banned porn and pissed off users, which led 30% of them to quit. The next year, Verizon offloaded Tumblr to WordPress' owner, Automattic, for $3 million, 0.3% of what Yahoo had paid for it.

Under Automattic, Tumblr is finally in the home that serves it, Levine says. ""We've had ups and downs along the way, but we're in the most interesting position and place that we've been in 18 years,"" he says. The site is trying to keep what its users love while unveiling features that do rival some of its competitors'. It's a shift after years of staying distinctly itself. In December, Tumblr launched its Communities feature, a sort of Facebook Groups meets subreddits in which people can join groups based on specific interests, like making art of ""silly bugs"" or emo kids from the Midwest. In January, Tumblr also launched a TikTok competitor called Tumblr TV, which works like a search engine for GIFs and supports videos. And following media companies (including BI) and social platforms like Reddit, Automattic in 2024 was making a deal with OpenAI and Midjourney to allow the systems to train on Tumblr posts.

How do we actually monetize people's intentions on social media versus the attention of them being around? Andrew Roth, founder and CEO of the consulting firm DCDX

But Tumblr is the 10th-most-popular social media site in the US, dwarfed by Facebook, Instagram, and X, according to data from the analytics firm Similarweb. (Tumblr declined to provide total user numbers to BI, but Levine says it has seen steady growth.) Its users see that as a pro rather than a con; it's more exclusive and intentional. But its history of extreme waves in valuation and struggles to make money may dictate its fate more than those who blog there. ""I want Tumblr to flourish,"" Brennan says. ""I want it to exist forever. I want to use it forever. I think that it is one of the most beautiful spaces on the internet for someone to figure out who they are."" But some of Tumblr's model is a ""blessing for it as a user is a curse for it as a business.""

The platform could benefit if it capitalized on the ""shift from attention to intention,"" Roth tells me. ""How do we actually monetize people's intentions on social media versus the attention of them being around?"" That would mean a focus on ""people's desires"" and how to ""help them reach them."" Tumblr recently put out a lengthy report for marketers trying to reach Gen Z, advising them to engage with communities around their brands and to search for relevant interest among users over the reach of mainstream influencers. Levine tells me that when Automattic acquired Tumblr, it was a chance for the company to take ""stock of where we are"" and ""reintroduce ourselves"" to users and ""brands and advertisers who help us pay the bills.""

Tumblr loyalists tell me they haven't spent much time with the new features — they like the site the way it is. TJ Smith, a 25-year-old from Texas, says it provided a safe haven for them when they were 13. Diagnosed as autistic at 11, Smith found Tumblr an easier place to connect with and talk about their favorite fandoms, like the Percy Jackson series. Eventually, it helped them work through their sexuality and gender identity (they identify as pansexual and gender fluid). ""Tumblr was the first place where I saw those terms being used,"" Smith tells me.

Most Tumblr blogs aren't about the people who make them, yet they're deeply personal places. Under their pseudonyms and art, people find communities and explore identities without scrutiny from IRL friends and family. Ashmita Shanthakumar, a 25-year-old from Utah who has been on Tumblr since 2013, sees it as ""anti-social media,"" she tells me, and has used it to connect with people who like the same CW superhero shows as she did. She can focus on how the shows make her feel rather than personal updates on Facebook, which can feel comparative.

The social internet is fractured. Millennials are running Reddit. Gen Xers and Baby Boomers have a home on Facebook. Bluesky, one of the new X alternatives, has a tangible elder-millennial/Gen X vibe. Gen Zers have created social apps like BeReal and the Myspace-inspired Noplace, but they've so far generated more hype than influence. People of different ages migrate in numbers to various platforms and seize them, creating the vibes and culture there. Platforms lean more left or right politically. And while some (mostly on the right) have cried ""echo chamber"" with derision, there are benefits to carving out smaller communities with like-minded people to see and talk about the things you like. Megaplatforms can flatten our online experiences and reward content that fits a mold; smaller communities can enrich them.

I recently unearthed the Tumblr blog I made in high school (don't go looking — I deleted it and my teenage musings immediately). When I scrolled through Tumblr for the first time in at least a decade, I realized it still had something that no other social network did: the sense of timelessness. I saw a post of a simple, soothing color gradient followed by a recent reblog of a GIF posted in 2020 but taken from the 2002 original ""Spider-Man"" movie. There's still little video on the feed, and it's more of a silent, visual retreat, with cuts of movie scenes overlaid with dialogue on a loop. When I open TikTok and Instagram, I'm bombarded by filtered faces and music, or someone yelling into the camera to sell me a pair of magnetic eyelashes every few videos. Tumblr was the place I went in 2011 to see and reblog flash photography and '90s movie GIFs, so it's no surprise that it's no longer just a place where decades of images are juxtaposed together, but one that has itself become a piece of nostalgia for a simpler time online. Unlike some of its 2000s peers, Tumblr doesn't need to fight to get its cool back, but it does have to find ways to keep its cool and move forward.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",African workers are taking on Meta and the world should pay attention,A landmark case could see Meta forced to take responsibility for workers’ rights abuses not just in Kenya but globally.,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/4/1/african-workers-are-taking-on-meta-and-the-world-should-pay-attention,2025-04-01,"A landmark case could see the US tech giant forced to take responsibility for workers’ rights violations not just in Kenya but globally.

In 2025, the world’s largest social media company, Meta, has taken a defiant new tone on the question of whether and to what extent it accepts responsibility for the real-world harm that its platforms enable.

This has been widely understood as a gambit to curry favour with President Donald Trump’s administration, and Meta CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg all but said so in a January 7 video announcing the end of third-party fact-checking.

“We are going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world, going after American companies and pushing to censor more,” Zuckerberg said, giving his product decisions a distinct geopolitical flavour.

To justify the company’s decisions to do away with fact-checking and scale back content moderation on its platforms, Zuckerberg and Meta have appealed to the United States’ constitutional protection of the right to freedom of expression. Fortunately, for those of us living in the countries Meta has vowed to “push back on”, we have constitutions, too.

In Kenya, for example, where I represent a group of former Meta content moderators in a class-action lawsuit against the company, the post-independence constitution differs from those in the US and Western Europe with its explicit prioritisation of fundamental human rights and freedoms. The constitutions of a great many nations with colonial histories share this in common, a response to how these rights were violated when their peoples were first pressed into the global economy.

We are now beginning to see how these constitutions can be brought to bear in the global technology industry. In a landmark decision last September, the Kenyan Court of Appeal ruled that content moderators could bring their human rights violations case against Meta in the country’s labour courts.

Few in the West will have understood the importance of this ruling. Meta, for its part, surely does, which is why it fought against it tooth and nail in court and continues to use every diplomatic tool at its disposal to resist the content moderators’ demands for redress. Meta has shown interest in appealing this decision to the Supreme Court.

Meta and other major US companies maintain a convoluted corporate architecture to avoid exposure to taxes and regulation in the dozens of countries where they do business. They commonly claim not to operate in countries where they count millions of users and employ hundreds to refine their products. Until now, these claims have rarely been challenged in court.

The case content moderators have presented in court is that they were hired by a business process outsourcing (BPO) company called Sama, and put to work exclusively as content moderators on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger during the period from 2019 to 2023, when much of the moderation for African content on these platforms was performed in Nairobi. Meta disavows these workers and insists they were employed solely by Sama, an issue currently being litigated before the courts in Kenya.

These workers know that Meta’s apparent reversal on content moderation is anything but. As presented in their grievances to the court, the company has never taken the issue seriously. Not seriously enough to stop the civil and ethnic conflicts, political violence, and mob attacks against marginalised communities that thrive on its platforms. Not seriously enough to pay fair wages to the people tasked with making sure it doesn’t. The harm travels both ways: Toxic content inflames real-world horrors, and those horrors engender more toxic content which saturates the platforms.

Content moderators are digital cannon fodder for Meta in a war against harmful content that the company was never really committed to fighting. The case presented by the Nairobi content moderators explains how they accepted jobs they thought would involve call centre and translation work. Instead, they ended up in Meta’s content moderation hub in Nairobi, where they spent their days subjected to an endless torrent of streamed violence and abuse.

Many of them were forced to view atrocities committed in their home countries in order to protect Meta’s users from the harms of seeing these images and footage. They absorbed that trauma so others in their communities didn’t have to, and many found this to be a noble calling.

But this work took its toll on their mental health. More than 140 former content moderators have been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, or anxiety arising from their time on the job. A separate case addresses how efforts to unionise to advocate for better mental healthcare were thwarted. What followed was en masse layoffs and relocation of Facebook content moderation elsewhere.

Advertisement

This left behind hundreds of trauma-impacted people and a trail of human rights violations. Meta argues that it never employed the Facebook content moderators and bore no responsibility to them. This litigation is ongoing, and the moderators now rely on the courts to unravel the complexities of their employment dynamics.

While fighting the case in court, in March 2024, the company sent a delegation led by its then-president of global affairs, Nick Clegg – a former British deputy prime minister – to meet with Kenyan President William Ruto and legislators to discuss, among other topics, the company’s vision of partnership with the government in bringing the “generative AI revolution” to the continent. At a townhall event in December, Ruto assured Sama, Meta’s former content moderation partner: “Now we have changed the law, so no one can ever take you to court again on any matter,” referring to a bill passed in Kenya’s parliament that shields Big Tech companies from future cases such as ours.

All this pushback occurred well before Trump was re-elected, and these efforts appear to be attempts to evade accountability for the company’s labour practices and the effects of its products. But something remarkable happened, which opens a door for others around the world who labour on behalf of the tech industry but whom the industry itself disavows: The court ruled that our case can proceed to trial.

The fact that the case has advanced despite vigorous legal and political challenges is a testament to the revolutionary nature of post-colonial constitutions, which prioritise human rights above all else.

As our case in Kenya continues, I hope it can offer inspiration for tech workers in other post-colonial nations that they too can pursue accountability in the countries where they have been harmed. The right to freedom of expression is an important human right, but we will continue to remind Big Tech that equally important are the right to dignity and freedom from exploitation.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other billionaire Ken Fisher’s top growth stock picks.

“Who am I to tell you anything, much less anything that counts? Or that there are only three questions that count and I know what they are? Why should you bother reading any of this? Why listen to me at all?”

This is the opening paragraph in one of Kenneth Lawrence Fisher’s books, “The Only Three Questions That Count: Investing by Knowing What Others Don’t.” Fisher has over ten books to his name, but that is not why investors pay attention to what he has to say whenever he says it. Known to many as Ken Fisher, the 74-year-old is ranked at position 212 in the latest Forbes Billionaires list (as of March 11, 2025). This is thanks to the $11.2 billion of wealth he has amassed through Fisher Investments, a firm that has more than $270 billion in assets under management.

Fisher has a lot to say about the market, and he is an active commentator on current events. As you’d expect, he had something to say about Trump’s tariffs. On Tuesday, March 11, 2025, President Trump doubled down on tariff talks, threatening to double the planned tariff on Canada-imported aluminum and steel to 50%. He said the levies would be effected in 24 hours and that if Canada doesn’t play ball, he “would set tariffs on cars from Canada so high that they would permanently shut down the Canadian car industry,” the New York Times reported.

President Trump has given four reasons for the tiff with Canada. On raising tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel, the president argued that the move is a response to Ontario bumping up prices on the electricity exported to the United States. He has also mentioned concerns about fentanyl trafficking, high levies on dairy imports, and that the tariffs are the current administration’s “broader strategy to use economic leverage to address national security concerns and promote domestic manufacturing.”

Fisher agrees with President Trump but only as far as the tariffs are negotiating tools. In a recent video posted on YouTube, he explains that tariffs are rarely fully enforced and argues that the actual impact of tariffs is often much smaller than people fear. The levies might be set at, say, 10-15%, but the real cost impact on goods is usually around 1.5%. He also emphasizes that markets often overreact to tariff announcements, causing unnecessary fear and volatility.",0.8862,0.049,0.87,0.081

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Meta profits as ads promote illegal Israeli settlements in West Bank,Companies are selling homes in illegal settlements and individuals are fundraising to buy weapons for Israeli soldiers.,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/3/31/meta-profits-as-ads-promote-illegal-israeli-settlements-in-west-bank,2025-03-31,"Companies are selling homes in illegal settlements and individuals are fundraising to buy weapons for Israeli soldiers in Gaza.

Facebook has platformed more than 100 paid advertisements promoting illegal settlements and far-right settler activity in the occupied West Bank, an Al Jazeera investigation has found, raising concerns that the social media giant is profiting from content that may violate international law.

Among the advertisements identified were also calls for the demolition of Palestinian homes, schools, and playgrounds, as well as fundraising appeals for Israeli military units operating in Gaza.

Facebook’s parent company Meta told Al Jazeera that any advertisements that ran on its platforms were reviewed by the company. While it admitted that some of the advertisements had since been removed for “violating our social issues, elections, and politics policies”, it did not specify whether the promotion of illegal settlements built on stolen Palestinian land breached those standards.

Legal experts told Al Jazeera that Meta could be complicit in violations of international law by approving, accepting payment, and publishing these advertisements. Brian Leishman, an MP in the United Kingdom parliament, described the findings as “extremely concerning”.

Illegal settlements advertised on Facebook

At least 52 paid advertisements from Israeli real estate companies were found promoting property sales in settlements across the occupied West Bank, targeting buyers from across Israel as well as some users in the UK and the United States. These advertisements were first published in March 2024, and many remain active on Facebook.

“We have robust processes and teams to review ads, and our ad review system is designed to review ads before they go live,” Meta told Al Jazeera. “This system relies primarily on automated technology to apply our Advertising Standards to the millions of ads that run across our apps, while relying on our teams to build and train these systems, and in some cases, to manually review ads.”

Among the advertisements identified by Al Jazeera were at least four promoting property sales in the illegal Israeli settlement of Ariel, 20km (12 miles) east of the Green Line in the occupied West Bank. The listings, written in Hebrew and targeting Israeli Facebook users, were paid for by a Facebook page called “Ramat Aderet”, which describes itself as offering “penthouses for a perfect quality of life”.

According to the website, the Ramat Aderet (Hillside Crown) project is “two neighbourhoods – north and south – with a total of 27 … buildings of between 4 to 8 floors. The apartments provide a complete urban living experience in a perfect neighbourhood.” The company has a valuation of $300m, according to PitchBook, a research firm and financial data provider.

Ramat Aderet did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.

The real estate company selling apartments and houses in Ariel is Ram Aderet, which has received financing from the First International Bank of Israel.

The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement has long called for a boycott of the bank over its role in financing illegal settlements. Following pressure, in January 2014, the Dutch pension fund PGGM withdrew investments from the bank, while insurance giant AXA divested in 2022.

Another 48 advertisements were posted by Gabai Real Estate, advertising homes in the occupied West Bank settlement of Ma’ale Adumim and the Efrat settlement.

These homes are part of an expansion approved in March 2024 by Israel’s “Higher Planning Committee”, which is overseen by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who, since 2023, no longer needs political or military approvals for expansion plans.

Yaniv Gabbay, the co-owner of Gabai Real Estate, told Al Jazeera: “Unfortunately, we were only able to post 48 ads because our budget is limited, and we advertise on many different platforms. But as we sell more homes to Jews returning home to Judea, our advertising budget will increase, and we can post more.”

Some Israelis refer to the occupied West Bank as Judea and Samaria, and the far-right government has made a push towards annexing the Palestinian territory.

The advertisements attempt to portray living in the settlements as idyllic. One lists an eight-bedroom mansion with a “huge garden, large succah area (seats 50+), above-ground pool, Jacuzzi, sauna, cold plunge, and breathtaking desert mountain views… A dream home just 20 minutes from Jerusalem! Don’t miss out!”

Carolina Are, a platform governance researcher at the Centre for Digital Citizens at Northumbria University, told Al Jazeera that “the real estate ads have been expertly framed as standard property listings, allowing them to elude moderation”.

“Moderators may not be aware of the nuances of international law either,” she added.

Under international law, all Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal. The transfer of an occupying power’s civilian population into occupied territory is considered a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.

Professor Aoife O’Donoghue, international law expert from Queen’s University Belfast, said: “On the West Bank, property can be privately bought and sold. However, whether they have the legal title to sell that land at all would be highly questionable.

“If the Israeli government is facilitating it, and they are settlements, then they would be in violation of the Third Geneva Convention. Here, the Israeli government has a duty to prevent illegal settlements.”

Settler groups pushing for demolitions

Al Jazeera also identified 50 advertisements posted by Regavim, a far-right settler group founded by Smotrich in 2006, that has called for the destruction of Palestinian homes, schools, and a children’s water park. The group receives funding from the Israeli government via the West Bank settlement councils, and also Amana, another pro-settlement organisation sanctioned by the UK and US governments.

One advertisement celebrated the demolition of a Palestinian school, boasting: “Following our petition, Civil Administration forces tore down an illegal Palestinian school built in the Herodian Nature Reserve… This school is only one out of more than 100 illegal school buildings.”

Another advertisement called for a Palestinian water park to be demolished, claiming: “Palestinians are enjoying themselves at our expense.”

Regavim defended the campaign against the school, saying it was “built for the sole purpose of creating confrontation”.

“[It] was deemed by the [Israeli] courts to pose a very serious and imminent danger to the safety and wellbeing of the Palestinian children who were being bussed in to fill the makeshift structure,” Naomi Linder Kahn of Regavim said.

The European Union has previously condemned the demolition of schools in the West Bank, and Human Rights Watch has described the practice as “discriminatory and violates children’s right to education”.

In October last year, nearly 90 US legislators urged then-President Joe Biden to impose sanctions on Regavim.

Regavim denies being a far-right or settler group, instead claiming to be a “mainstream, professional contributor to public discourse and is a frequent participant in national policy discussion and debate”.

But Leishman, the British MP, said: “Revelations that Israeli far-right pro-settler groups as well as businesses – and allegedly even active Israeli soldiers – may be using social media to promote what could be seen as illegal under international law are extremely concerning.”

Facebook fundraisers for Israeli soldiers in Gaza

Beyond settlement expansion, Meta has also platformed fundraising advertisements for Israeli military units operating in Gaza, even after a ceasefire was declared.

Legal experts say allowing such advertisements may violate international humanitarian law by promoting military operations in occupied territory.

Nine advertisements, paid for by Israeli singer Mayer Malik, sought donations for sniper teams, drone units, and special forces battalions deployed in Gaza. One advertisement, still active on Facebook, reads: “We urgently need shooting tripods to complete our mission in Jabalia.”

Other advertisements requested funding for drones for the Yasar Battalion and an elite Israeli army unit in Rafah, as well as night-vision goggles for the Golani Brigade.

Malik did not respond to two requests for comment from Al Jazeera.

According to Meta’s advertising guidelines, “Ads must not promote the sale or use of weapons, ammunition or explosives. This includes ads for weapon modification accessories.”

Professor Neve Gordon of Queen Mary University, UK, said: “Facebook is making money from criminal activity.

“By allowing third parties to post such ads, Facebook becomes complicit in their criminal activity, since the ads themselves play a role in whitewashing, normalising and legitimising acts that, according to international humanitarian law and the Rome Statute, are egregious crimes.”

Leishman added: “Social media giants should be a lot more careful about what they allow to appear on their platforms, rather than profiteering from organisations with a dangerous and divisive agenda.

“It is time for them to start taking responsibility so that they are not complicit in systematic violations of international law.

“Everyone is under an obligation not to recognise, aid or assist in maintaining the illegal occupation of Palestinian territory – social media giants are not exempt or above the law.”",-0.9963,0.089,0.855,0.057

While algorithms have their place, there has been a massive backlash against their incessant use on the likes of Facebook, partly because they gobble up personal data, but also because the recommendations are often rubbish.

This is something that apparently even Facebook is aware of. The social media giant has just announced that it is going back to its roots with a massive update to the Friends tab. Here, users are promised that they will be shown only content from their friends and no recommended content at all.

See also:

Before you get too excited about the death of the algorithm, there are a few points to keep in mind. Firstly, it is only the updated Friends tab that is being purged of recommended content -- this will still be found everywhere else on Facebook. Secondly, this is a staggered rollout that sees the update hitting the US and Canada for now. Other countries are likely to be added in the future, but no details are available yet.

Announcing the update, Meta says:

We want to make it easier for people to find their friends’ content on Facebook. So starting today in the United States and Canada, the new Friends tab provides an experience made up entirely of content from your Facebook friends. Formerly a place to view friend requests and People You May Know, the Friends tab will now show your friends’ stories, reels, posts, birthdays and friend requests. The Friends tab is available initially through the navigation bar on your home Feed and can always be accessed in the Bookmarks section of the app.

Meta says that this is just the start of its work. The company says that it will be bringing back “several “OG” Facebook experiences throughout the year”.",0.9939,0.027,0.813,0.16

Shopping, banking, gaming, and even controlling the temperature in your home - you name it, there’s an app for it. The iOS app store began in 2008 with 500 apps, yet, now there are over four million apps available across iOS and Android platforms. Each of these apps serve individual needs and consumers have learnt to ignore the digital clutter in favor of app loyalty.

Asia went the opposite way. Instead of narrow-purpose-built apps, they built the 'everything app' long before Elon started dreaming about it with platforms like Paytm, Grab and WeChat. But what would it take for the West to catch up? AI super agents might be the answer to that one.

Why the West resisted the super app

Super apps struggled to gain traction in the West because user behavior and technology there evolved along a very different path than in Asia. The West started with desktop internet, which got users accustomed to various apps catering to individual needs instead of offering a unified experience. Countries in Southeast Asia, meanwhile, led the mobile-first consumer economy, prioritizing ease and integration, skipping the desktop internet phase altogether.

This means the West has fostered far stronger app (or ‘brand’) loyalty -- some users will never stray from Deliveroo for their Friday night takeaway, while others rely on JustEat. For a super app to succeed in the West, it would need to combine the best features of well-loved apps into one cohesive interface, which is challenging to say the least. Some western giants have certainly tried, whether it's Uber adding flights, trains, and food delivery, or Meta introducing gaming, marketplace, and even dating into Facebook. Still, these haven't come close to the mega-app status of something like WeChat.

Enter AI super agents

As much as super apps may have struggled to coalesce in the West, AI super agents could be their second chance. Unlike traditional apps designed for specific tasks, these agents can adapt to a wide range of user needs. We’re not a million miles from it now, as AI language models like DeepSeek, Llama 3, Claude 3.5, Gemini and GPT-4o are already designed to support many use cases, with Agentic AI taking that even further.

The real strength of these AI super agents will be their ability to personalize experiences. They won’t just aggregate service but analyze preferences and habits to provide tailored recommendations, such as an AI that can help you find a good restaurant based on your dietary preferences, your favorite cuisine and where you went last week. It could also go a step further to suggest dishes based on past orders and make reservations for you -- all while checking traffic conditions to ensure you arrive on time.

There’s a strong argument for integrating our favorite apps into these intelligent systems. Historically, apps have been built for narrow purposes -- often just one at a time. With millions of apps competing for our attention, this model may not be sustainable in the long run. Instead of creating larger apps that attempt to do everything, we could see networks of specialized AI agents collaborating seamlessly.

This integration would also change what it means to be a developer. Instead of building separate apps for iOS, Android, and web platforms, they could focus on creating robust APIs that AI agents can interact with. Many startups come up with fantastic ideas every day but often hit roadblocks due to a shortage of skilled developers. AI super agents could democratize app development by letting people without extensive coding skills bring their ideas to life using natural language -- turning everyday conversation into programming.

The UX Challenge

But making AI super agents successful hinges on user experience. The digital assistant needs to sit at the OS level, on devices with powerful GPUs and lightning-fast connectivity. The interface must be intuitive and responsive across different input methods -- whether it’s voice commands or touch gestures. Human-machine interaction relies on effective information presentation, and tactile feedback is important because ultimately people want to see, hear, and feel their technological interactions.

Another major challenge to overcome will be making sure these agents comply with stringent data protection and privacy laws that otherwise make it unappealing for developers to process large datasets through an AI. Wouldn’t it be much easier if managing online privacy resembled a graphic equalizer? It would be a lot more user-friendly, while still giving the user control over personal data.

Where super apps failed in Western markets, AI super agents may well be the key to delivering on their promise of streamlining daily life. At the end of the day, the point of technology is to address real issues, not to keep you within any particular app or ecosystem.

The tone of this post, which likely reflects that of the book it discusses, is overwrought. But that does not make it inaccurate. What caught my attention was the inclusion of Myanmar as an example of Facebook’s malign influence. The human cost of that civil war, which does have the US and China both stoking it, is ignored in the Western press. For instance, Myanmar is now on the verge of famine. The UN fingers the conflict as playing a major role.

One of the problem with books like this is that, in order to sell, they have to give considerable weight to the personality of the founder/CEO. That often leads to undue emphasis on scandalous-seeming details and muddles the message of how the broligarch lack of respect for rules, laws, and boundaries leads to misuse of power. The EU was ploddingly on the path of using its strict competition rules to curb the ambit and even conceivably the size of tech titans like Facebook and Google. But their process is slow. This horse has left the barn and is already in the next county.

By Lynn Parramore, Senior Research Analyst at the Institute for New Economic Thinking. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website

Early in her chilling account of life as a Facebook executive, Sara Wynn-Williams drops an intriguing detail: Mark Zuckerberg’s favorite president. The young founder – still in his twenties at the time — picks Andrew Jackson, because he “got stuff done.”

“What about Lincoln or Roosevelt” the author asks the boss. Didn’t they get stuff done, too? Zuckerberg insists: “It’s Jackson. It’s not even close.”

Zuckerberg’s admiration for Jackson, known for his ruthless, authoritarian style—despite the bloodiness of his territorial expansion and role in the Trail of Tears—sheds light on much of what follows. Jackson made decisions unilaterally, and if you didn’t like it, you’d be steamrolled. He moved fast and broke things.

And that’s just what Zuckerberg does at Facebook, Wynn-Williams contends: creating “an autocracy of one.”

Fresh from her role as a New Zealand diplomat at the United Nations, Wynn-Williams joined Facebook fueled by a starry-eyed belief in its mission to connect and improve the world. As an advisor to Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, she helped shape the company’s strategy with governments globally. But over time, she was horrified to witness Zuckerberg’s inner circle cozy up to authoritarian regimes like China, help ignite deadly chaos in Myanmar, and meddle catastrophically in U.S. elections: “I was on a private jet with Mark the day he finally understood that Facebook probably did put Donald Trump in the White House [in 2016], and came to his own dark conclusions from that.”

All the while, she alleges, Zuckerberg and his top brass deceived the public, hid their actions, and lied to Congress. In Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism, Wynn-Williams illustrates how Zuckerberg aimed to expand Facebook by hook or by crook—and she insists that there has been no shortage of crook.

Superpowers for Juveniles – What Could Go Wrong?

It’s not too surprising that what unfolded during Wynn-Williams’ time at Facebook, from 2011 to 2017, wasn’t so much a Machiavellian plot as it was, in her words, ‘like watching a bunch of fourteen-year-olds who’ve been given superpowers and an ungodly amount of money, as they jet around the world to figure out what power has bought and brought them.”

Zuckerberg comes off as a petty tyrant, combative and often surly, who throws fits if he loses board games and lives in a bubble where no one dares contradict him. Sandberg is revealed as a self-aggrandizing hypocrite, brutally demeaning and even sexually harassing female employees as she burnishes her “Lean In” image as a defender of women – and uses that deceptive image to curry favor for Facebook. Her real stance with female employees, writes the author, is “Lean in and lie back.”

When Wynn-Williams is brought onto the Facebook team by Marne Levine, a former Larry Summers protégé, her first exposure to the company’s culture is receiving a “Little Red Book,” which proclaims, “What we’re doing is more than capitalism; it’s social justice. Facebook is social change, humanitarian change. And we are a family. The Facebook Family.”

Family duties here mean being on call 24/7, and doing whatever it takes to keep Zuckerberg and the higher-ups satisfied. Sandberg herself insists that employees should be overloaded with work because “spare time” is where “trouble starts.” It’s a culture of exhaustion and control, where the staff is expected to comply without question, overlooking ethical concerns—like manipulating politicians with Facebook’s algorithms, publicly preaching privacy while secretly working to provide the Chinese government access to user data, and more. It’s a place where they’re expected to risk arrest or physical harm, stay silent when superiors make sexual advances, and hire only those loyal to the inner circle. All in the name of keeping the machine running.

Wynn-Williams pulls no punches when exposing Facebook’s darker side, with one key villain in the story being Joel Kaplan, a former George W. Bush aide and Sandberg’s ex-boyfriend. Kaplan – currently enjoying the title of Chief Global Affairs Officer at Meta – is hired to handle Facebook’s relations with Republicans. His mission is to get politicians hooked on the platform so they’ll use it to win elections, and in return, Facebook gets to run wild, free from regulation. He’s all in on the strategy of buying off politicians, so oblivious to the law that he doesn’t even realize bribery is, you know, illegal. His specialty is selling political ads. Money-driven politics? A-ok with Kaplan.

Perhaps only a New Zealander like Wynn-Williams could have written the line, “I’m astounded at the role money plays in elections in the US … on every issue from guns to abortion to much else.” Getting politicians to view the platform as their ticket to winning elections is, she argues, Facebook’s “ace”—the surefire way to avoid taxes and regulations. And once they got the U.S. game down, she contends, Facebook took this playbook global, with Sandberg pushing Kaplan to hire teams in Asia, Latin America, and Europe to teach politicians how to target voters with tailored ads, making them depend on Facebook for political power.

Now, Zuckerberg’s affinity for shenanigans like tax dodging probably won’t surprise anyone – how he teamed up with the Irish government on shady schemes like the “double Irish,” designed to skirt taxes. But it may raise eyebrows to read how Zuckerberg and his cronies apparently saw terrorism as a golden opportunity to get governments—eager to catch terrorists—to relax privacy laws. Wynn-Williams recounts how, after the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris, Sandberg, attending the World Economic Forum at Davos, gleefully sent an email to the leadership team, “Terrorism means the conversation on privacy is ‘basically dead’ as policymakers are more concerned about intelligence/security.” In other words, tragedy = opportunity. If it strengthens your stranglehold on global politics, why not seize it?

Zuckerberg’s so-called “humanitarian” initiatives also come under fire. Internet.org, marketed as a way to bring the internet to the world’s poor, turns out to be nothing more than a cynical bait-and-switch. Instead of providing open, free internet access, it traps the poorest people in Zuckerberg’s ecosystem, forcing them into a Facebook-centric platform. The result? Governments have more control over what users see, and those users are more vulnerable to hate speech, fraud, and censorship.

The situation became deadly in Myanmar, where Facebook became the de facto gateway to the internet through Internet.org. Instead of promoting peace and understanding, Facebook became a tool for hate. Wynn-Williams describes how in 2014, hate speech targeting the Rohingya Muslim minority went viral on the platform, triggered by a false post accusing a Muslim man of raping a Buddhist woman. The violence that followed was horrific, but Facebook’s content moderation team claimed there was nothing they could do. When the UN later debunked their story, Facebook’s response was silence.

As Wynn-Williams puts it, “Facebook is helping some of the worst people in the world do terrible things… an astonishingly effective machine to turn people against each other.”

Meanwhile, Wynn-Williams considers Facebook’s role in the 2016 U.S. election as undeniable, holding that Zuckerberg and his team knew exactly what they were doing when they profited from Trump’s campaign, which was driven by misinformation and trolling. She alleges that Joel Kaplan saw outsider candidates like Trump as good for business—after all, inflammatory content generates engagement. Facebook insiders were so sure of their influence that they referred to 2016 as “the Facebook election.” Staff even embedded with Trump’s team to craft a targeted ad strategy using tools like “Custom Audiences” and “Lookalike Audiences,” helping Trump outspend Clinton on Facebook ads, making the platform his largest source of campaign funds.

Wynn-Williams’ account of Facebook’s dealings with the Chinese government is seriously alarming, and she claims Meta is right now actively blocking her from addressing Congress on the matter.

She alleges that under Zuckerberg’s direction, Facebook developed censorship tools for the Chinese Communist Party, including systems to monitor user posts. Despite publicly refusing to store user data in countries like Russia, Indonesia, and Brazil, Facebook agreed to store Chinese user data in China. Wynn-Williams writes that internally, the company feared exposing its hypocrisy—handing over data to China while resisting U.S. government requests, even concocting a scheme (which didn’t come to fruition) to justify its presence in China with a New York Times column by Nicolas Kristof. When Congress began asking questions, Zuckerberg was instructed to downplay the situation, claiming only Chinese data would be stored in China, even though non-Chinese data could also be temporarily stored on Chinese servers.

Then, there’s the horrific exploitation of teenagers that readers may recall from news reports. Wynn-Williams tells of the 2017 leaked documents revealing that Facebook targeted vulnerable teens for ads when they were feeling emotionally distressed, like when they felt “worthless” or “anxious.” Facebook tracked their interactions and body image concerns to drive engagement, even working with beauty companies to target girls right after they deleted selfies. All this while Zuckerberg and the company publicly claimed to have moral integrity. Behind the scenes, they knowingly designed addictive features to exploit young users, maximizing engagement at any cost.

Oligarchs in Ascendancy — How Can Anything Go Right?

It’s a bad sign when the author admits her ultimate hope amid all the malfeasance was that Facebook’s powerful algorithms—those same ones causing so much chaos—might be slowed down, not because they’re harming society, but because they could hurt Facebook’s bottom line. She thought this would happen with the explosion of chaos in Myanmar, but despite knowing how its platform fueled tensions that resulted in genocide, Facebook did nothing. The company’s response? Silence.

A key underlying problem, Wynn-Williams observes, it that Facebook’s top tiers are populated by a bunch of out-of-touch Harvard grads, far more interested in protecting their own interests than making the world a better place. By the end of her memoir, she concludes that Facebook is, in her words, a company that has become “an astonishingly effective machine to turn people against each other and monitor people at a scale that was never possible before.” For authoritarian regimes, it’s a dream tool. As Wynn-Williams succinctly puts it, “It gives them exactly what those regimes need: direct access into what people are saying from the top to bottom of society.”

Wynn-Williams’ time at Facebook came to a head in 2017 when she was fired, allegedly in retaliation for her complaints about Joel Kaplan’s sexual harassment—a fitting exclamation point on a story of idealistic dreams twisted into a corporate nightmare.

What about the nightmare for the rest of us? Regulating Meta obviously requires stronger legal frameworks, transparency, and accountability to ensure it serves the public good and curbs harmful practices.

It’s not hard to figure out that Facebook’s dominance and acquisitions of competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp should be subject to stricter antitrust laws. Breaking up Facebook or imposing limits on its acquisitions could foster competition and curb its unchecked power. (Despite Zuckerberg pouring $1 million into Trump’s inauguration, axing diversity programs, and scaling back social media content moderation to appease the president, the Trump administration is still using antitrust law to pursue anti-monopoly action against Meta—at least for now).

It’s also clear that governments could regulate political ads on Facebook, ensuring transparency on ad spending and sources, helping prevent foreign interference, misinformation, and unethical targeting tactics.

There’s a powerful argument that companies like Facebook should be treated as public utilities because they’ve become essential to communication and information, much like water or electricity. With billions relying on them for everything from socializing to business and news, these platforms hold massive societal power. Treating them as utilities would make them more accountable and regulated, ensuring they serve the public good instead of just chasing profit. This could help tackle problems like misinformation, privacy breaches, and monopolies while boosting transparency and fairness.

However, by most accounts, Mark Zuckerberg, rather than learning from past mistakes, is wholeheartedly embracing his role as a 21st-century oligarch. Recently, Meta announced it had terminated 20 employees for leaking confidential information to the media, amid growing scrutiny over Zuckerberg’s recent political shift toward aligning with President Trump. He also sat down with Joe Rogan, the podcast king, delivering a bold message: American business culture needs more masculine energy. If Meta was a noxious bro-fest before, we can only imagine the chaos that’s coming.

It’s not a pretty picture. But ultimately, if we want a fairer and more transparent digital landscape, the task is clear: level the playing field, restore trust, and ensure that the digital spaces we rely on serve us, not just their bottom line. Perhaps a tell-all from a former female employee can get the ball rolling. Stranger things have happened.",0.9785,0.109,0.766,0.125
"META Platforms, Facebook.",Fake election news ads are luring people into investment schemes.

The CBC News visual investigations team looked into it — and got some taken down.

How we busted this fake election content luring you into get-rich-quick schemes

Fake CBC News articles that link to sketchy investment schemes are flooding social media with sensational headlines about the Canadian election and other recent political developments.

CBC's visual investigations unit reported on a similar scam in late January , where fake articles lured victims to Quantum AI, a well-known scam. But this latest generation of fake content has been updated to take advantage of new events with surprising speed. One fake article referencing a federal tariff relief initiative is dated March 23 — Prime Minister Mark Carney made a similar announcement days earlier , on March 21.

After CBC News reached out to Facebook parent company Meta and the Toronto-based company hosting one of the website domains, several of the Facebook accounts behind the ads were disabled and one website domain was suspended.

Clicking on one of the Facebook ads takes the user to a realistic-looking CBC News article. (Other news outlets have also been spoofed, though most of the ads seen by CBC News were purporting to show an article from the public broadcaster.) Read on, though, and the articles tout a ""zero risk"" cryptocurrency investment scheme.

Two examples of fake CBC ads, which lead to fake articles, that circulated on Facebook. The trail eventually leads to a sketchy investment trading platform. (Screenshot/Facebook)

In one case, the Facebook ads even featured an AI-generated deepfake video of CBC journalist Rosemary Barton, as well as Elon Musk, and Carney. In the fake video, Carney says the government has certified the safety of the alleged investment product and that ""none of the investors will lose their money.""

""All you need is to invest $350 and start making profit from the first month,"" the deepfaked prime minister said. The deepfake was created using manipulated video originally taken from Carney's Liberal leadership launch speech in January.

""There is not going to be a decline in the number of these soon, particularly with the election,"" said Marissa Sollows, director of communications for the Financial and Consumer Services Commission of New Brunswick, which issued warnings about the scheme this month.

""We are working certainly with our national and international counterparts, regulatory counterparts and enforcement staff at examining all kinds of different ways that we can look at disrupting and raising awareness of this — recognizing that it is such a Whac-A-Mole game. When you take one down, 10 more pop up.""

Variety of trading platforms linked

Each fake article directs readers to a realistic-looking trading platform, such as Canada Crypto Fund, TrueNorth, or Token Tact.

The New Brunswick FCSC issued warnings about all three of those entities in March, warning they are ""not registered to deal or advise in securities in New Brunswick.""

The fake articles often were hosted under strange and unrelated URLs — marslandingjournal.com or gossipgiraffes.com, for example — while some were more convincing, such as cbc-politics.com.

A screenshot of a fake CBC ad seen on Facebook that included a deepfake video of Mark Carney, left, compared with a frame from the real Carney Liberal leadership speech from Jan. 16. (Screenshots/Facebook and CBC News)

One of the ads CBC News investigated was posted by a Facebook page called ""Tokens Ailive."" Clicking on the links in the article sent CBC News to two different sites claiming to be trading platforms at two different times.

The trading sites then ask users to make a minimum deposit — usually several hundred dollars — to begin trading, either by submitting credit card information or by calling a representative.



That process closely resembles the Quantum AI scam previously investigated by CBC News.

'Scammers use every platform available:' Meta

CBC News also analyzed the websites hosting the articles and trading platforms.

Two of the trading platforms are hosted by Cloudflare, a major internet firm based in the United States. The company did not respond to CBC's request for comment.

One of the sites registered its domain name with Tucows, a Toronto-based company. After CBC News contacted Tucows, the company suspended the domain.

Madeleine Stoesser, Tucows's senior manager of corporate communications, clarified that the company uses a wholesale model. That means the website owner purchased the domain from a reseller. ""We work closely with our resellers to address issues similar to this domain,"" Stoesser told CBC News.

During the investigation, CBC News saw fake ads sharing the articles being listed, and in some cases removed, from Meta's Ad Library, a database of ads that run on Meta platforms that was created to address transparency concerns.

CBC News reached out to Meta for comment and provided several additional examples of pages sharing the fake ads. Meta said in a statement the company had removed the Facebook ads CBC News flagged and disabled the accounts sharing them.

""This is an ongoing industry-wide challenge — scammers use every platform available to them and constantly adapt to evade enforcement. Our work in this area is never done, and we continue to invest in new technologies and methods to protect people on our platforms from scams,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

The RCMP, along with the Canadian Securities Administrators and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, noted in a recent statement a specific concern with ""the increasing prevalence and sophistication of online investment scams."" Investment fraud cost Canadians $310 million in 2024, the organizations said.

The CSA noted that for the first time, ""scams among younger Canadians have trended upwards.""

Ryan Duquette, national lead of digital forensics at MNP, a consulting firm, told CBC News that several issues hamper the ability of social media companies and law enforcement to crack down on schemes like these.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Two senior Meta executives — Dan Neary, vice president for Asia-Pacific, and Kate Hamill, managing director for retail and e-commerce in North America — are leaving the company after more than a decade each in key leadership roles. The departures are unrelated.

Neary, who joined Meta in 2013, announced his decision to step down in a LinkedIn post on Thursday. He described the move as the end of a ""12-year run,"" during which he helped grow the company's business across the Asia-Pacific region.

Based in Singapore, he oversaw Meta's expansion in some of its largest and fastest-growing international markets, including Australia, Southeast Asia, and Greater China.

""It's hugely gratifying for me to look back at the small Singapore office where this journey started over a decade ago and see how far we have come together,"" Neary wrote. ""It's been the ride of a lifetime on the Meta APAC rocket ship.""

He added that he would remain for a few months to help with the leadership transition before taking a break to spend time with family and explore the next steps.

Neary's exit marks the end of an era for Meta's Asia-Pacific operations, which have seen explosive growth over the past decade. Asia is now Meta's largest user base, home to over a billion accounts across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.

Meta's platforms have become essential for communication, commerce, and digital advertising in India, Indonesia, and Thailand. The region also continues to be a key driver of Meta's business messaging and performance ad revenue.

Hamill, who spent 13 years at Meta, will join Pinterest as vice president of enterprise sales for North America starting April 7. She will oversee revenue and sales teams in the US and Canada and work closely with Pinterest's Chief Revenue Officer, Bill Watkins.

Hamill led Meta's advertising relationships across major verticals, including retail, travel, entertainment, and gaming. She also worked closely with product teams on offerings like mobile app ads.

In a LinkedIn post earlier this week, she said she was drawn to Pinterest's focus on ""AI-driven and lower funnel ad solutions "" and the company's mission to build a ""more positive online space"".

Her departure is notable given her role in strengthening Meta's ties with major US advertisers during a period of rapid growth in its ads business. She helped launch and scale tools like Advantage+, automatically optimizing ads to reach likely buyers using AI. Advertising remains Meta's primary source of revenue.

Neither executive gave a specific reason for their departure. After publication, a Meta spokesperson told BI that Neary decided to leave for ""personal reasons.""

""Dan's impact on Meta has been extraordinary, and he's built, grown, and led our APAC business to incredible heights,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are very grateful for Dan's leadership and contribution and wish him the very best.""

Meta did not comment on Hamill's departure.

"META Platforms, Facebook.","Media Briefing: Overheard at the Digiday Publishing Summit, March 2025 referral traffic edition",Execs in a closed-door town hall session during the Digiday Publishing Summit were quick to share their frustration with declining traffic — but there were some glimmers of positive signs too.,http://digiday.com/media/media-briefing-overheard-at-the-digiday-publishing-summit-march-2025-referral-traffic-edition/,2025-03-27,"This article is part of Digiday’s coverage of its Digiday Publishing Summit. More from the series →

This week’s Media Briefing recaps what publishers had to say about referral traffic (which, spoiler alert, is as volatile as ever) during the Digiday Publishing Summit’s closed-door town hall sessions.

The volatility of referral traffic is nothing new for publishers. Media executives had a lot to say about their frustration with declining traffic in a closed-door town hall session during the Digiday Publishing Summit in Vail, Colorado, this week — lamenting about everything from trying to make sense of Google’s Search and Discover platforms to the expansion of the tech giant’s AI Overviews feature.

In fact, referral traffic is a hot topic that was discussed at the previous Digiday Publishing Summit.

But this time around the referral traffic talk wasn’t all bad. There were glimmers of positive signs too. For example, some execs shared strategies to help boost referral traffic, such as content formatting. And, believe it or not, some said they were seeing increases in traffic from Meta platforms like Facebook and Threads. Some publishing execs are even daring to ask, is referral traffic coming back?

But the unpredictability of traffic from platforms like Facebook and Google over the years has meant even big upticks come with a healthy dose of skepticism. People weren’t exactly leaping out of their chairs in excitement about the return of Facebook referral traffic.

Here’s what publishing execs had to say at the Digiday Publishing Summit about their referral traffic woes — and wins:

For many, referral traffic is down

“We haven’t seen a big recovery [in social referral traffic] at all, or maybe … we had a tiny bit.”

“We invest a lot of time in fixing [SEO, site page speed, load times], and haven’t seen … the results I thought we were going to see. … We might have seen a 10, 20% bounce. Because my thought was, that means for 20 years we’ve sucked at doing [this]. … We thought that everything was so bad, and if we fix it, we’ll double our traffic back. [That] was naive and unfortunately a waste of time last year from this.”

“In the past two years, we’ve been seeing year-over-year traffic declines. But we’re actually growing revenue in spite of the traffic declines. And the way that we’ve been thinking about it is the top of the funnel is shrinking, but the bottom — we control everything there. So we’ve been working very hard on improving converting users.”

“Reddit has been dropping over the last couple months.”

“[Facebook] offered us a chance four or five months ago to start monetizing it. We’re like, oh, we’ll take that cash. We’re like 500 bucks a month and no traffic.”

But for some, referral traffic is up

“So this is a little tough to measure, because there’s so many variables in good traffic months, and we’ve had some really good SEO months. They seem to coincide with an effort to apply much better content formatting to our stories, [like bullet points, headlines and subheaders].”

“I think the one insight that we do have is adding bullets at the very top of the story does not seem to hurt engagement. I think there was a concern about that. Like, if you give away the whole story at the top, you’re going to lose that sort of scroll up. That doesn’t seem to have happened.”

Are Meta platforms improving?

“We had this automatic posting on Threads where our Instagram got connected and we weren’t even looking at it. Then in January … it just went bonkers. And since then, [our team has] been focusing [on it].”

“We were part of the [Facebook] partner program. But of course, we don’t have conversations with anybody about that. All of a sudden it just shows up. Hey, you’re monetizing this page well. … [Revenue and referral traffic] is actually up a little bit from the worst. The worst was actually last November-ish or so, and I would say it’s up about 30% from there. So there is some positive news on the Facebook front. But it’s still drastically different than it was two years ago, and certainly different than it was six years ago.”

AI’s impact on referral traffic remains to be seen

“I think there was this existential concern that you’re going to see a really big decline in search because of what’s happened with AI. We just haven’t seen that. … People aren’t [using AI tools to look] for local news stories.”

“All this time we’ve been building a product, the value for the product has been for users who have grown up with Google being ubiquitous. But now we’re building for a new audience, where ChatGPT is ubiquitous, and we’re going to change everything about our product for these new users. So that’s the mentality we’re approaching the loss of traffic with.”

“I’d argue that AI Overviews is not actually having an impact on all your traffic as much as search algorithm updates and the paid results — the changes to those themselves for [e-commerce] and various different features on the search results page. We’ve done the test on AI Overviews a number of times, talked to other tech SEOs in the industry, and it’s something like 3 to 8% of search traffic. So if you’re seeing 3 to 8% of your search traffic decline, then yeah, sure, AI Overviews. I don’t think you’re talking about that. I think you’re talking about something much more.”

Google Discover is still a mystery

“We were not in [Google Discover] for a long time. We couldn’t figure out why. We read all the articles on how to do it. We did a lot of different testing, and I think honestly, deleting a lot of old content that was out of date is probably what helped, because some of it might have had light aspects of NSFW around it, and Google wants Discover to be really, really clean.”

“One thing about [Google Discover] is it’s entirely topical based, at least from our understanding. … They have a taxonomy that you can almost figure out by looking sometimes at what they put next to the article. They’ll show you like five little tiles and what it is. So if you’re trying to tackle Discover, I would think use topics as a way to figure out what’s working.”

“What we get from Discover is always very spike-driven. … Those results look a lot different than our other referral sources. But over the course of a year, it’s definitely been like a nice, impactful source of traffic force over the last few years. I still don’t think we totally understand it, and we had to give it slightly different attribution.”

What we’ve heard

“If you ask [Perplexity] about meaningful revenue there, they really can’t answer on it right now. They’re very, very quiet on analytics. … We ultimately ended conversations with Perplexity because it just felt like there wasn’t enough there yet. … But I worry for us that we’re missing a window and I’m super conscious of that.”

"META Platforms, Facebook.","Facebook Adds ‘Friends Tab’, Nodding To Its Roots: “Social Media Should Be More Social”","Facebook is adding a “Friends tab,” a feature enabling users to focus in on posts shared by their friends and family members.

The new initiative enables Facebook to invoke its early mission from two decades ago, even as it continues pushing aggressively into AI, algorithmically recommended content and branded fare.

In its earliest days when it was incubated by founder Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm room, Facebook had a central goal of connecting people with their classmates, friends and family members. Over the years, as the social network’s reach extended to billions of people around the world, it saw strategic benefit in automation. When it began pumping recommended posts into user’s feeds several years ago, the move initially prompted backlash before the effort was dialed back and somewhat refined.

Debuting today in the U.S. and Canada, the new Friends tab provides an experience made up of content from users’ Facebook friends. It is available initially through the navigation bar on the home feed and can be accessed in the “bookmarks” section of the app. “Formerly a place to view friend requests and People You May Know, the Friends tab will now show your friends’ stories, reels, posts, birthdays and friend requests,” the company explained in a blog post. “Social media should feel social.”

Watch on Deadline

The Friends Tab isn’t an either/or proposition, and will coexist with more recent forms of content distribution. Within the Friends Tab, users will see only posts recommended or shared by people in their network. Outside of the tab, content will circulate as it has been. The goal is to at least offer a taste of what members of the senior management team have dubbed “OG Facebook.” The tech giant rebranded as Meta Platforms in 2021, reflecting its aim to transcend the social media brand that started it all.

“Connecting with friends has been a part of Facebook since it launched,” the blog post said. “Over the years, Facebook evolved to meet changing needs and created best-in-class experiences across Groups, Video, Marketplace and more, but the magic of friends has fallen away. We’ll be adding several ‘OG’ Facebook experiences throughout the year.”",0.9682,0.013,0.889,0.098
"META Platforms, Facebook.",Advertisers are starting to walk away from platforms’ AI solutions that once promised them everything,"It's hard to deny that AI will have a larger part of media buying — even as marketers will stall, resist and negotiate every inch of the way.",http://digiday.com/marketing/advertisers-are-starting-to-walk-away-from-platforms-ai-solutions-that-once-promised-them-everything/,2025-03-26,"It’s hard to deny that AI will have a larger part of media buying — even as marketers will stall, resist and negotiate every inch of the way.

And who can blame them? The uneasy feeling that handing over control to AI, whether through Google’s Performance Max or Meta’s Advantage+ which each promised easier media buying, puts them further from understanding what they’re actually buying has been gnawing at them for a while. Back in December, media buyers voiced those concerns to Digiday. Now, it looks like they’re finally doing something about it.

That’s certainly true of one client at audience curation business Crowd Louder Media. According to John Davis, director of audience development at the company, they have just cut their Google spend by 50% — most of which was going on Performance Max — and moved half of it into the open web. However they didn’t share specifics on how much that spend accounted for. To be fair, some of this pushback stems from marketers hitting the ceiling on Performance Max, where pouring in more dollars just leads to diminishing returns, Nevertheless, those concerns might’ve been easier to stomach they say, if the platform’s AI had inspired more confidence.

“I have clients who’ve transitioned out of Performance Max completely, to a mix of Google ads, search campaigns and outside of the walled garden, open web campaigns using display and online video and connectedTV, etc,” he said. “I’d even expect to be able to cut a Facebook budget in half as well.”

It’s a similar perspective for Sara Kerr, associate media director at ZGM Modern Marketing Partners.

“I had one client where their Performance Max CPM was pretty much the same as their search CPM, so I cut their PMax spend in half,” she said. “We’re actually onboarding a client right now where they have a horrifically large spend in Performance Max that I’m immediately concerned about. It’s going to be a tough conversation.”

These concerns aren’t new. The lack of transparency around where ads are going, what’s working and whether the return justifies the spend has long been a sore spot. But now, those lingering doubts are turning into action, driven by a growing realization that these AI-driven solutions may not be as efficient as promised.

At best this means wasted budget; at worst it can mean losing control of the entire media strategy.

“Some days it [Google’s Performance Max] might spend almost nothing, and then it might spend double or even triple the budget. I’ve seen it happen,” said Kerr. “For example, I saw it had such a high CPM though I was sure it was only running in search. They [Google] really do need to allow you to see where all the placements are running.”

And what probably didn’t help was the recent Adalytics report that found ads being served next to child porn — a sobering reminder of the risks that can happen when marketers are not in control of their own advertising.

“In the marketing and media space right now, there’s a lack of transparency and questions over where our ads are showing up,” said Mary Ann Pruitt, president and CEO of Mosaic Media. “Plus Google and Meta will most likely also have some legislation and regulations that will take place. All of these things are continuing to fuel what already was a baseline of distrust.”

Still, it’s tough to say whether these moves are a sign of real change or just a stall tactic. After all, platforms don’t take their cues from advertisers — they play their own game and everyone else is left reacting. That won’t change unless marketers start walking away from these solutions. And judging by the latest data, that’s nowhere near happening.

Meta, for example, revealed during its 2024 fourth quarter earnings that Advantage+ revenue surpassed a $20 billion annual run-rate, growing 70% year over year. And while Alphabet didn’t explicitly call out Google Performance Max’s run rate for the same time period, a report by Tinuiti indicated that more than 95% of retail advertisers running shopping ads had adopted PMax. Additionally, PMax made up 69% of shopping ad spend for the median retailer during the same Q4 2024, per Tinuiti’s report.

Maybe this is just another doomed attempt by marketers to wrest even a sliver of control from the platforms. Time will tell.

“Their [Google] typical response is “give it time” and trust us to handle your advertising by leveraging our AI,” said TJ Kropp, head of search at Ramp97. “However, when campaign performance using their AI black box dips, there is no ‘why’. The lack of transparency to reproduce or improve upon campaign results is a significant deterrent. It forces us to focus on ‘traditional’, controllable methods that can drive optimal results.”

Maybe this is just another doomed attempt by marketers to wrest even a sliver of control from the platforms. What’s clear already, though, is the creeping regret that’s settled over much of the industry. Marketers are investing in tools that get the job done but there’s a gnawing sense that something better might’ve been within reach if they’d played it differently. That’s the sting: not failure, but the uneasy feeling they settled too soon. Perhaps, that’s what this pushback really signals — a reckoning not just with platforms but their own uneasy compromises.

“Many marketers today are already comfortable with spending millions of dollars on (non-AI powered) black boxes: connectedTV being one of them,” said Brian Leder, founder and president of Ramp97. “For those marketers who are already comfortable buying in non-transparent environments, we hope there’s no further capitulation to this defacto way of advertising.”

A Google spokesperson said the company is aware of these concerns from advertisers and noted that Performance Max is designed to support diverse business goals, with recent updates like asset-level reporting and impression share metrics driven by feedback. The spokesperson also pointed to tools for budget management, placement transparency and strict policies to ensure brand safety, especially around age-sensitive content.



Additionally, in response to this article, a Meta spokesperson told Digiday: “The vast majority of feedback we hear about Meta Advantage+ is overwhelmingly positive given its proven ability to efficiently drive results at scale. Advertisers have the control to choose what ad tools they use and define the conversions they value most.”

Based on recently released court documents, Reisner says Meta employees downloaded and used the Library Genesis (LibGen) database, one of the largest pirated libraries available online.

Within the database are 53 of my own copyrighted works, including various editions of the books I’ve written, some co-authored books, a book where I wrote a foreword, and one story published in a magazine.

Move Fast and Steal Things

I know it seems like I’m beating up on Meta this month, writing last week Freedom of Speech? The Book Facebook Wants to Suppress.

However, it’s a coincidence that the new book Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams and the Atlantic article by Alex Reisner were both published within the last few days.

Reisner says Meta has argued in court “that it’s “fair use” to train their generative-AI models on copyrighted work without a license, because LLMs “transform” the original material into new work”. However, Reisner shares details from court documents that “Meta employees acknowledged in their internal communications that training Llama on LibGen presented a “medium-high legal risk,” and discussed a variety of “mitigations” to mask their activity.”

It's not like they can’t afford to pay for data. Meta Platforms is one of the most valuable companies in the world. In 2024, annual revenue was USD $164 billion and net profit was USD $62 billion.

AI is transforming the world

Yes, I am an enthusiastic and vocal supporter of the power of Artificial Intelligence to transform business and life.

I use AI every day in my work (such as the AI generated image to illustrate this post).

I’ve written often about AI and delivered talks to thousands of people on the topic. I’ve also invested in and advise AI companies. So yes, I am all in on AI.

At the same time, for more than twenty years I’ve pioneered the idea of using content as a form of marketing. I’ve advocated putting content out there for free to educate and inform potential customers, the media, investors, and others. I’ve published nearly 2,000 blog posts, have been a guest on hundreds of podcasts, and all of this is freely available. I’ve got a bunch of videos of my talks available for anyone to watch. I’ve published a bunch of free ebooks and hundreds of LinkedIn articles.

I’m totally cool with Generative AI tools training on all content that I put out there for free! Have at it.

However, Meta chose to rip off my paid content without my permission (or my publishers’ permission) and use it in ways I didn’t authorize.

Not cool, Zuck, not cool.

Tanya O’Carroll, a human rights campaigner based in London, U.K., launched a lawsuit against Meta in 2022, alleging the company had breached U.K. data laws by ignoring her request to stop Facebook from collecting and processing her data for targeted ads based on topics it thought she was interested in.

On Friday, Meta settled the lawsuit with O’Carroll, who created her Facebook account 20 years ago. The company also agreed not to use her data to target her with personalized ads in a settlement the human rights campaigner describes as a “victory.”

The Information Commissioner’s Office, the UK’s data watchdog, also supported O’Carroll’s argument in the case, explaining that “people have the right to object to their personal information being used for direct marketing.”

The Information Commissioner’s Office also adds that Instagram and Facebook users should have an “opt-out” from their data being used to create targeted ads.

According to a report in The Guardian, the settlement in the privacy case could likely set a precedent for millions of social media users in the U.K. Meta says it is now considering charging UK users for an ad-free version of its platforms after the legal agreement that avoided a trial in the high court in London.

Meta tells The Guardian that it “fundamentally” disagrees with O’Carroll’s claims and took its obligations under the UK’s privacy law, GDPR, seriously. The company is weighing the option of introducing a subscription service in the UK, whereby users would pay a fee for an ad-free service. Ads account for over 96% of Meta’s revenue, according to the company’s latest quarterly financial results.

“We are exploring the option of offering people based in the U.K. a subscription and will share further information in due course,” Meta says.

O’Carroll tells TechCrunch that she is unable to disclose full details of the tracking-free access Meta will be providing in her case but she confirmed that she will not have to pay Meta.

This paid model in the U.K. will likely follow the subscription model that was introduced in the European Union (EU). Facebook and Instagram users in the EU have been able to pay for a subscription model to avoid ads on their feeds since October 2023.

Snap CEO Evan Spiegel says creativity starts with failure — and he makes sure new hires get there quickly.

Snap's new designers are asked to present an idea on their first day despite having little context or time to prepare, Spiegel said on a recent episode of ""The Diary of a CEO"" podcast.

""When you have no context for what the company is working on, no idea what's going on, how on earth are you supposed to come up with a great idea? I mean, it's almost impossible,"" Spiegel said.



""So your worst fear has come true — we're all sitting there, looking at an idea that's ultimately not that great.""

First days can be nerve-racking enough without being asked to make an ill-prepared presentation to your new colleagues. But for Spiegel, that early failure is precisely the point.



By forcing new hires to showcase an idea with no preparation, context, or background, Spiegel believes the worst fears around failure evaporate early, leaving employees creatively liberated.

""Ninety-nine percent of ideas are not good — but 1% is,"" he said. ""And the best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas.""

Ultimately, Spiegel said, ""All feedback is good feedback. What you do with it is what matters.""

Spiegel credits Snap's creativity to its culture of constant experimentation more than a decade after its launch.

Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, famously introduced disappearing photos and videos and became known for introducing features like Stories, which were later copied by platforms including Instagram and Facebook.

Spiegel's LinkedIn profile recently poked fun at this, describing him as ""VP Product @ Meta"" — a gag an employee was behind, he told Bloomberg.

Spiegel founded Snapchat while studying at Stanford and became the world's youngest billionaire at 25.

Snap completed a 2017 IPO with a valuation of about $24 billion. Its market cap now stands at $15.65 billion. The company famously turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Mark Zuckerberg's Meta — then Facebook — in 2013.

Spiegel also pushed back on perfectionism in startup culture. ""People who think the game is to have the perfect idea — those are people who've never built a business before,"" he added.",0.8672,0.083,0.817,0.101

The pace at which these platforms evolve means staying ahead of the curve is no longer optional — it’s essential for any brand that wants to make an impact. Are you prepared to stay ahead in your social media strategy? Here are the trends you’ll want to watch out for in the coming year.

Short-Form Video Domination

Short-form video will continue to dominate in 2025, with platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts leading the charge. These bite-sized videos are proven to capture attention and drive engagement, making them essential for brand storytelling.

Marketers will likely double down on short-form video content, optimizing it for mobile-first audiences. In 2025, interactive elements like polls, shopping features, and live videos within short-form content will become more common, offering users a more immersive and interactive experience.

AI-Driven Content Creation

Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a buzzword — it’s reshaping the way content is created, shared, and consumed. In 2025, we can expect to see AI-powered tools used more widely for content generation, from automated captions and posts to personalized video creation.

Platforms like Instagram and TikTok are already experimenting with AI-driven content suggestions. AI can study user behavior to craft tailored content that speaks directly to each person, resulting in higher engagement and improved conversion rates.

Businesses will likely adopt AI tools to streamline content production and create hyper-targeted campaigns, ensuring content feels more authentic and relevant to users.

Social Commerce Expansion

Social commerce — shopping directly through social media platforms — will be a massive trend in 2025. While Instagram and Facebook already offer built-in shopping features, expect this trend to expand further as more platforms integrate ecommerce capabilities.

As social commerce grows, influencers and brands will increasingly turn social media into a seamless shopping experience, allowing users to go from discovering products to making a purchase — all within the same app.

Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest are already building features to make the shopping experience more intuitive, and we’ll likely see new features such as augmented reality (AR) try-ons, advanced product recommendations, and even virtual stores.

Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality Integration

Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are gaining traction in social media, and by 2025, they’ll be even more embedded in the user experience. We’re already seeing AR features on platforms like Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook, where users can try on makeup, clothes, and accessories virtually.

In 2025, expect AR and VR to become even more immersive, with platforms offering new features like virtual showrooms, 3D product demos, and immersive experiences that make online shopping feel as tangible as in-store experiences. These technologies will help brands connect digital and physical experiences, boosting both engagement and conversions.

Influencer Marketing Evolves

Influencer marketing is far from fading; in fact, it’s evolving. As we move into 2025, micro and nano-influencers (those with smaller but more engaged followings) will become even more important. This shift is driven by the growing desire for authenticity in brand partnerships.

Brands are increasingly looking to collaborate with influencers who have niche audiences that match their target market. According to AdParlor, expect influencer partnerships to be more collaborative, with creators having a say in the content they produce, making the messaging feel more authentic and relatable.

Brands will also start using AI tools to track and optimize the ROI of influencer campaigns, helping them make the most of these collaborations.

Social Media Platforms Embrace Privacy and Data Security

As data privacy concerns increase, social media platforms in 2025 will prioritize transparency and give users more control over their personal information. This will include more granular privacy settings and clearer opt-in consent forms for data usage.

Brands will need to adapt to these changes by ensuring they handle user data responsibly and comply with evolving privacy regulations. To earn back user trust, social media platforms are gearing up to introduce stronger security features, ensuring better protection from data breaches and creating a safer online space for their communities.

Sustainability and Social Responsibility in Social Media

In 2025, sustainability and social responsibility will be central themes for brands on social media. With increasing awareness of environmental and social issues, users are demanding that brands take a stand on important causes.

Brands will be expected to showcase their sustainability efforts and involvement in social justice causes through transparent and impactful messaging. Social media will keep playing a crucial role in helping brands express their values and engage with communities that resonate with those ideals.

In the future, expect to see a surge in campaigns centered around sustainability, charitable causes, and inclusivity.

Metaverse Integration

Though the Metaverse has been steadily growing in popularity, 2025 could mark its emergence as a dominant force in the social media world. As virtual worlds and immersive experiences evolve, platforms like Facebook (now Meta) are pushing forward with the integration of the Metaverse into their platforms.

For marketers, this could mean new virtual spaces for branding, advertising, and community building. Think of virtual stores, events, and live experiences that users can access with VR headsets or other immersive technologies. The Metaverse offers an entirely new world for brands to explore and engage with users in a novel way.

Ephemeral Content Remains Key

Ephemeral content — posts, stories, or videos that disappear after a set time — will continue to thrive in 2025. Platforms like Instagram Stories, Snapchat, and even LinkedIn Stories have proven that temporary content creates urgency and fosters more engagement.

In the near future, brands will likely lean more into ephemeral content to create a feeling of exclusivity and urgency, encouraging audiences to engage before it disappears. From behind-the-scenes glimpses to limited-time offers, ephemeral content will remain a valuable tool for driving engagement and creating authentic, real-time interactions.

AI and Automation in Social Media Management

As the demands of social media management grow, businesses will increasingly rely on AI and automation to streamline processes like content scheduling, customer service, and social listening. AI-powered tools will help marketers create more targeted content, analyze audience sentiment, and automate responses to customer inquiries.

In 2025, social media automation will be further refined, with more tools offering smart insights and personalized recommendations to optimize campaigns. While automation will increase efficiency, it’s crucial for brands to balance it with a human touch to maintain authenticity.

Final Thoughts

Social media in 2025 will be all about deeper engagement, more immersive experiences, and enhanced personalization. With AI transforming content creation, AR/VR pushing new boundaries, and social commerce booming, brands that keep up with these emerging trends will be the ones that truly stand out and build stronger connections with their audiences.

By embracing these trends, marketers can create more engaging, impactful social media strategies that resonate with the audiences of tomorrow. Now is the time to get ready, so your brand stays ahead and succeeds in the constantly shifting social media world.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Traffic referrals from Threads surge for some publishers this year,"Social referral traffic is ticking up this year, and some publishers are seeing surges in referrals from Threads specifically.",http://digiday.com/media/traffic-referrals-from-threads-surge-for-some-publishers-this-year/,2025-03-24,"“Social as an audience driver is back.”

That’s what Josh Awtry, svp of audience development at Newsweek, told Digiday after last Wednesday, when the publisher saw the most social referral traffic to its site on a single day in five years.

Newsweek’s social referrals from all platforms are up almost 10 times compared to the average day in March last year, Awtry said. Social made up less than 3% of Newsweek’s traffic mix at this time a year ago. But this month, social referral traffic has more than doubled as a percentage of the overall referral mix — and close to tripled over the past week, according to Awtry.

Newsweek’s referral traffic from Threads has surged 20-fold since January. Before then it had been just a few thousand daily page views, he said. Threads now drives more traffic for the publisher than X, despite it having a fraction of the follower count on the former — Newsweek has 3.5 million followers on X compared to 160,000 followers on Threads, which Meta launched in July 2023. Engagement on Threads has also increased, he added.

So what’s driving all of this? Meta-owned platforms. Yes, you read that right. Meta hasn’t exactly been a best friend to publishers lately (or even just an acquaintance). Meta has pretty much turned its back on publishers — shutting down its News tab last year, removing Instant Articles in 2023 and overhauling its algorithm in 2018 to de-prioritize content shared by publishers (and essentially tanking their Facebook referral traffic).

But Meta announced it would start getting friendlier with publishers this past January, specifically those publishing political news. In 2021, Meta decided to reduce the visibility of posts about elections, politics and social issues, but since the beginning of this year, that content has been phased back into Meta’s social feeds.

Historically, Newsweek has generated “very little” readership from Threads, Awtry said. But since Meta’s January announcement, the publisher started posting more often on the platform — up to multiple times an hour.

Meta has recently added new features to Threads that help users control and personalize their experiences, such as adding topics to bios and improved topic tagging, according to an update from the company last week. It noted that posts with tagged topics receive more views. Meta plans to announce more features, which it claims will be useful for publishers on Threads, according to a spokesperson.

Newsweek isn’t the only publisher experiencing these gains. Politico had the most referrals from Threads to date in February. March referrals are up almost 50% month over month, according to a spokesperson from the publisher.

Forbes started putting a lot more effort into Threads and posting more as its stories began gaining traffic in January, and, as a result, referral traffic is now up 711% year to date, according to Kerry Lauerman, executive editor at Forbes. Forbes now posts on the platform at least once an hour, more than double what the publisher was posting in December, Lauerman said.

And that’s where the “chicken and the egg” situation comes in, according to an executive at another publisher, who asked to speak anonymously. They said their referral traffic on Threads was up 677% month over month at the beginning of March. This publisher started seeing more referral traffic coming from Threads in January and upped its posts on the platform. Now it posts on Threads hundreds of times a day.

“There are so few places that right now we’re seeing that sort of acceleration in referrals,” the exec added. Threads is now bringing in more referral traffic than channels like Reddit and MSN, and is on par with platforms like NewsNow, NewsBreak and Bing, according to the exec.

The executives interviewed for this story said they’re seeing a range of topics and post types perform well on Threads — including images and link posts that span across a variety of coverage areas, including news and entertainment.

For what it’s worth, Threads is making big gains in monthly active app users. Threads had 46.5 million monthly active app users in the U.S. in February, up 143% year over year, according to Similarweb data. (X had 56.2 million.) Meta said in January that Threads had more than 320 million monthly active users.

Chartbeat data also shows that, on average, Threads referral traffic to publishers has doubled in the past six months. But it still makes up less than 1% of referral traffic for publishers in aggregate.

But not all publishers have seen a bump in referral traffic from Threads — not even all news publishers. Publishers like The Guardian, The Boston Globe and three other news organizations that asked not to be named said they hadn’t seen any major shifts in Threads referral traffic.

The jury’s still out on how meaningful this traffic is to publishers’ overall audience ambitions and revenue. Referrals from Threads remain a tiny portion of publishers’ overall traffic — even if the channel is growing. Social makes up less than 10% of Newsweek’s overall referral traffic, Awtry said. The anonymous publishing exec said Threads referrals are just a single-digit share of its overall referral traffic mix.

While traffic spikes help bring in more readers to publishers’ sites (though let’s face it, they will likely be short-lived once there’s another inevitable algorithm tweak), they’re unlikely to excite too many chief commercial officers focused on daily audience in terms of how much digital ad revenue they’ll actually bring in.

“Threads remains small compared to other sources, so growth should be viewed within that context. As such, we will continue to monitor growth, and experiment accordingly,” the Politico spokesperson said.

One thing is clear: The time when publishers could rely on continuous traffic surges from Meta referrals is over. But those who are seeing lifts from Threads are happy to ride the current wave, no matter how long it lasts. Despite these improvements in referral traffic from Meta’s platforms (for some), none of those interviewed for this story said they would be pouring resources into Threads to keep the momentum going.

“The goal is ultimately to bring more discussion back to our own channels. We are going to lean hard into Threads as a page view driver but I also don’t want to fall into the same traps that we all fell into in 2018,” Awtry said. “If we’re going to invest more resources or grow our social team’s presence, it’s going to be around engagement on our own channels.”",0.9991,0.004,0.884,0.111

Facebook and Instagram owner Meta is considering a paid subscription in the UK which would remove adverts from its platforms. Under the plans, people using the social media sites could be asked to pay for an ad-free experience if they do not want their data to be tracked. It comes as the company agreed to stop targeting ads at a British woman last week following a protracted legal battle. Meta already provides ad-free subscriptions for Facebook and Instagram users in the EU, starting from €5.99 (£5) a month. A spokesperson for the firm said the company was ""exploring the option"" of offering a similar service in the UK.

They said the firm was ""engaging constructively"" with the UK data watchdog about the subscription service, following a consultation in 2024. The Information Commissioner's Office previously said it expected Meta to consider data protection concerns before it launched an ad-free subscription. Meta says personalised advertising allows its platforms to be free at the point of access. Guidance issued by the regulator in January states that users must be presented with a genuine free choice. Social media platforms such as Meta heavily rely on ad revenues, and the company says personalised advertising allows its platforms to be free. Advertising accounted for more than 96% of its revenue in its latest quarterly financial results. Other social platforms including Snapchat, TikTok and X (formerly Twitter) have also looked to ad-free options as a way to raise more money through subscriptions.

Consent or pay

A number of online services, such as news publishers, are asking users to either pay up or consent to being tracked while using the platform for free. The Guardian became the latest UK publisher to start doing this in March, following in the footsteps of the Daily Mirror, the Independent and others. The advertising model, known as ""consent or pay"", has become increasingly popular. Publishers say they have no choice due to growing pressures on their finances, while campaigners say it is unfair to users to ask them to pay up in exchange for not being targeted with ads. And ""consent or pay"" models may fall foul of data protection law in the UK if a user's consent has not been ""freely given"", according to the ICO. ""If organisations choose to adopt a 'consent or pay' model, they must demonstrate the model is compliant with UK data protection law,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""This means that, among other data protection standards, organisations must demonstrate that people can freely give their consent to processing of their personal information for personalised advertising.""

It’s available to Digiday+ members. More from the series →

Meta’s Facebook and Instagram platforms, TikTok, and YouTube are an integral part of marketers’ strategies this year (again), but how exactly will they know whether they’re successful on those platforms? Engagement, impressions and sales will be the top performance metrics marketers will be looking at in 2025.

That’s according to a Digiday+ Research survey of 150 marketer professionals conducted in Q1 of this year.

Digiday’s survey found that the top three social platforms among marketers this year are Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok (yes, I know that’s four — stay with me). Instagram is the No. 1 social platform for marketers as of Q1 2025, with 93% of marketer pros saying their companies currently use the platform, followed by its Meta sibling Facebook, at 84%. YouTube and TikTok tied for third place, with 65% of marketers saying their companies currently use each platform.

It’s a slightly different picture from what social media marketing looked like six months ago, but the key word here is slightly. Instagram and Facebook were still the top two social platforms in Digiday’s Q3 2024 survey, with 97% of marketer pros saying their companies were using Instagram and 89% saying they were using Facebook. TikTok came in a definitive third place, though, with 86% of marketers saying their companies were using the platform — a significant difference from the 65% who said the same in Q1 of this year. YouTube came in fourth, with 73% of marketers using that platform as of Q3 2024 — another notable difference from the 65% who said they’re currently using the platform in Q1 2025.

Once we move out of the top three (slash four) social platforms, the percentage of marketers who use the different social platforms falls off significantly. Pinterest came in fourth place among the platforms included in Digiday’s Q1 survey, with less than a third of marketers (29%) saying their companies use Pinterest, and X came in fifth place, with just 16% of marketers using the platform. Reddit tied with X for fifth.

When it comes to how marketers are measuring success on the social platforms they use, engagement turned out to be the most important metric. More than a quarter of marketer pros (26%) said engagement is their main measurement of success on Facebook, more than a third (37%) said the same of Instagram and nearly half (42%) said engagement is their main measurement of success on TikTok, making it the top metric on these platforms.

Of the top social platforms in Digiday’s survey, only YouTube had a metric other than engagement come out as the top measurement of success: 34% of marketers said impressions are their main measurement of success on YouTube. A significant percentage of marketers still consider engagement to be important on YouTube, though. Thirty-one percent of marketer pros said engagement is their main measurement of success on the platform.

Digiday’s survey found that commerce or sales is also important for marketers on the top social platforms — it showed up as one of the top three metrics on all of the top three (OK, technically four) platforms. Twenty-nine percent of marketers said commerce or sales is their main measurement of success on Instagram, 25% said the same of Facebook, 15% of marketers said the same of YouTube and 18% said the same of TikTok.

Digiday’s survey found that cost is a major hurdle for marketers when it comes to advertising on social platforms — which, in today’s environment, shouldn’t necessarily come as a surprise. Cost of media is the top challenge marketers chose on both Meta platforms (which maybe says something about the state of advertising with the social giant): 28% of marketer pros said cost of media is the biggest challenge they face on Instagram and 23% said the same of Facebook.

Lack of budget is the top challenge on YouTube — so, along the same lines as Instagram and Facebook. Twenty-three percent of marketers said lack of budget is the biggest challenge they face on YouTube. This challenge also came up for marketers on TikTok — 17% said lack of budget is their biggest challenge on the platform — but it didn’t come out as the top challenge there. Lack of resources and content demands did, with 18% of marketer pros choosing it as their top challenge on TikTok.

It’s also worth noting that 19% of marketers said lack of budget is the biggest challenge they face on Instagram, and that cost of media is the No. 2 challenge among marketers on YouTube, with 22% of respondents to Digiday’s survey saying it’s their biggest challenge on the platform.",0.9989,0.019,0.82,0.161

Instagram Shopping is a feature that allows eCommerce brands of any size to create a shareable, shoppable catalog of their products right on Instagram.

Users can either purchase directly on Instagram (with Checkout) or click through to finish the transaction on the brand’s website.

For most brands, ecommerce should not be the primary focus of your Instagram account. This is a network that’s particularly effective for building long-term relationships that lead to high customer value over time. But shopping should definitely be part of your Instagram strategy. The stats back this up:

People are looking for products on Instagram: 44% of Instagrammers use the platform to look for product reviews or recommendations, and 7% of U.S. consumers start their shopping searches on the platform. And those people follow through on their searches: 37.3% of U.S. Instagram users will make at least one purchase through the platform in 2025. Make sure your products are there for them to find, and easy to buy when they do.

How to get started in 6 easy steps

Step 1: Convert to a Business or Creator Account

If you don’t already have a Business (or Creator) account on Instagram, it’s time to take the plunge.

Besides qualifying you for Instagram Shopping features, Business accounts also have access to detailed analytics… and can use Hootsuite’s scheduling dashboard for posts, too.

Just tap Edit Profile, then Switch to professional account. Want more details? Here’s our step-by-step guide to switching your personal account over (and 8 reasons why you should!).

Step 2: Use Commerce Manager to set up a shop

1. Head to Commerce Manager to set up Instagram shopping. When you visit Commerce Manager for the first time, you’ll see a Get Started screen. Click Next to enter the workflow and set up your shop.

2. If you’re using a partner platform like Shopify or Magento, you can select it to create your Instagram shop directly on that platform. Otherwise, select I don’t use these platforms and click Next.

3. Choose the country where your shop is located. This will impact your available checkout methods. If your shop is based in the United States, you need to use Checkout on Facebook or Instagram, so it will bump you straight through to sales channels. For other countries, you can select Checkout on another website, or Checkout with messaging.

4. Select the Instagram business account you want to be associated with your shop. If you don’t already have a business portfolio set up on Meta (for a Facebook shop or Facebook business page), you’ll need to create one.

5. If you already have a product catalog set up on Meta , select it. Otherwise, click Create new catalog and give it a name. You’ll add products after you finish setting up your shop.

6. Select where you ship to, review your shop details, and click Finish setup to submit your shop for review by Meta.

Step 3: Upload your product catalog

6 tips for optimizing your profile for Instagram shopping

1. Curate your products and collections

Rather than making your shop a free-for-all, you can curate your products into categories and collections based on trends, seasonality, or any other theme that makes sense for your business.

Head to Commerce Manager, and under Catalog, click Sets, then Create set. You can choose to manually add products to a set or use filters to automatically group products by type, price, or other attributes. These sets appear as collections in your shop.

You can also customize the layout of your Instagram shop to highlight a specific collection, product, or offer.

In Commerce Manager, click Shops, then Edit Shop. Above the image of your shop, click Preview to open the interactive preview and editing options.

Meta can automatically personalize your shop for each person if you toggle on the Optimize layout switch. If you’d prefer to set things up manually and adjust them to work with specific campaigns or seasonal promotions, you can do that using the options on the left of the screen.

For example, 32 Lakes Coffee Roasters has their shop set up using automatic optimization for each user. Since I’ve purchased locally made clothing through brands I follow on Instagram before, the shop automatically shows me the brand’s T-shirts and sweatshirts before any of the actual coffee. Scrolling down, I get to the collection of Customer favorites – not surprisingly, coffee features more prominently here.

On the other hand, environmental home essentials brand etee places their collections up top and has the auto-generated Suggested for you category further down the page.

2. Focus on high-quality product images and descriptions

There’s not a lot of space for copy on your Instagram shop homepage, so product images really need to do the heavy lifting.

“Take the time to style and professionally photograph each individual item you’re selling,” says Rengie Wisper, marketing manager at Palmako. “Zoom in and get detailed shots that highlight the textures, colors and unique features of your products. You really want them to pop on that small screen! After improving my own product images, I saw a noticeable boost in engagement and sales.”

But save the static product images for your shop homepage and catalog. In your shoppable content (Instagram Stories, Reels, posts, and carousels), show your products in context rather than in isolation.

“Show someone wearing your bestselling earrings in a lifestyle setting – perhaps a casual coffee date or night out.” says Aaron Whittaker, VP of demand generation & marketing at Thrive Digital Marketing Agency. “Tag the earrings, include a short eye-catching caption (such as “A little sparkle goes a long way – tap to shop your next favorite pair!”), and use relevant hashtags.”

Or, as in this shoppable Instagram ad from LF Jewellery, you could do both. A quick video of someone wearing the necklaces is combined in a carousel with clean product imagery featuring multiple tagged products.

Source: LF Jewellery

Don’t neglect the product descriptions. The product image catches potential buyers’ attention, but the product information copy is critical to build trust and drive conversions.

3. Use Reels to entertain and sell

While nearly half (44%) of Instagram users say they use the app to look at product reviews and recommendations, 86% say they use Instagram because it’s entertaining. In order to build relationships that drive Instagram sales, you need to focus on providing solid entertainment value for your audience.

Entertainment doesn’t have to be comedic – you need to find the tone that best fits with your brand voice. Then look for ways to feature your products in content that provides solid value to your audience, and use product tags to drive taps through to your shop.

One example is to provide insights into how your products are made, as Earth Angel does in this behind-the-scenes Reel with a shopping tag:

4. Use UGC to create brand trust

User-generated content (UGC) refers to any posts or Stories from other Instagram users that feature your brand.

Not only do these posts provide new, real images of your photos in action, but they also boost your credibility. That’s because posts from real users are considered more authentic, and that authenticity translates to higher trust.

“For a fashion client, testing user-generated content versus professional photography revealed a 20% higher conversion with authentic, user-centered posts,” said Kiel Tredrea, president & CMO of RED 27 Creative.

Fortunately, Instagram shops have a built-in way to connect product tags and UGC. When someone tags your brand account in a post, you can tap into the Shopping tools on the Instagram app to request permission to add product tags. The original creator will get a notification and can choose to accept or decline your request.

If they accept, the post can appear on your product page in a section called From the Community.

You can also encourage your followers to tag your products directly in their content, as this functionality is available to anyone unless you limit permissions on product tags. For instance, in this post on my own account, I can tag the jacket that I bought from Simons.

However, I can’t tag my sunglasses because Ray-Ban has turned off the ability for users to tag their products. That said, I could still tag the Ray-Ban account and they could request to tag the product if they choose.

We’ve got a whole post on how to encourage UGC to get you started.

5. Try shoppable collaborative posts

If you don’t want all Instagram users to be able to tag your products, you can choose to limit product tagging to your brand partners (aka influencers). This is a great way to link posts from your creator partners directly to your Instagram shop.

You can also create collaborative Instagram shopping posts. In this case, the post appears on both your brand account and the account of the person you choose to collaborate with. The product tags appear in both versions of the post and therefore reach double the audience.

6. Create anticipation with a launch preview

If you connect your Instagram shop with a shopping partner like Shopify or a merchandise provider like Spring, you can create a product launch event with previews of the items you’ll launch at a specific time. This builds anticipation and excitement about your launch and can create an early influx of orders when the items go live.

The artist behind @loxythemaker used an Instagram launch set up through Shopify to tease the launch time of her new collection of earrings. When they went live, several designs sold out within 24 hours.

FAQ

Do I need a Business account to use Instagram Shopping?

Yes, you need to convert your Instagram account to a Business or Creator account to access Instagram Shopping features. This also unlocks analytics and scheduling tools.

How long does it take for my Instagram Shop to get approved?

After setting up your shop in Commerce Manager and submitting it for review, Meta typically takes a few days to approve it, though it can vary depending on your account and catalog details.

Can I use Instagram Shopping if I’m not in the US?

Yes, Instagram Shopping is available in many countries, but if you’re outside the US, purchases will link to your website instead of using Checkout on Instagram, which is US-only.

What’s the easiest way to add products to my Instagram Shop?

Answer: You can manually add products in Commerce Manager, but integrating an eCommerce platform like Shopify or BigCommerce makes it faster and automatically syncs your existing catalog.

How can I make my Instagram Shop more engaging for customers?

Answer: Use high-quality images, curate products into collections, tag products in Reels and Stories, and leverage user-generated content (UGC) to build trust and excitement.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Bipartisan Effort to Sunset the ‘26 Words That Created the Internet’ Is on the Way,The law has drawn ire from both the left and the right.,https://gizmodo.com/bipartisan-effort-to-sunset-the-26-words-that-created-the-internet-is-on-the-way-2000579297,2025-03-21,"Section 230, the linchpin law that has dictated how online platforms have been regulated for decades, appears destined to come to an end. According to The Information, Democratic Senator Dick Durbin and Republican Lindsey Graham are planning to introduce a new bill that will set an expiration date for the law and encourage tech companies to offer alternatives as to what should replace it.

Per The Information, the bill could be introduced as early as Monday, March 24, and is expected to have bipartisan support from Republicans Josh Hawley and Marsha Blackburn and Democrats Sheldon Whitehouse and Amy Klobuchar, who are reportedly ready to co-sponsor the bill. It’s also a modified version of a proposal made last year in the House by Republican Cathy Rodgers and Democrat Frank Pallone, Jr., so there is some juice for this thing throughout Congress. The proposal would effectively sunset Section 230, setting January 1, 2027, as a drop-dead date for the law that so many tech companies have leaned on to duck legal challenges.

The gambit that Durbin and Graham appear to be attempting is to force tech companies to the table and talk about Section 230 alternatives. By setting a deadline, the message is basically, “Come help us write the replacement law or lose this protection in its entirety.” The latter should be basically an intolerable outcome for tech firms, as it would leave them extremely exposed to legal challenges.

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as it stands, essentially grants companies legal immunity from being held legally liable for the content posted on their platforms by users. It is often referred to as the “26 words that created the internet” because it created a framework for user-generated content. But its legal protection of companies has come under fire from both major political parties for very different reasons.

Democrats have come after Section 230 for allowing Big Tech companies to be derelict in their duties to remove harmful and hateful content, falling short of the “Good Samaritan” standard of good faith moderation. Scrutiny from the left turned up during the COVID pandemic when misinformation was rampant on platforms like Facebook and some Democrats wanted the company to do more to address the issue. Republicans, meanwhile want Section 230 repealed because they believe tech companies have been overzealous in removing content and think their viewpoints have been “censored.” It’s here where you can see the cracks start forming in this bipartisan effort.

There is probably room to reevaluate the protections granted under Section 230. After all, it was written in 1996 when the internet was in its nascent stages and the monopolistic forces of companies like Meta or YouTube would have been hard to imagine. For instance, it might be worth asking, even if platforms shouldn’t be held liable for what random users post, should they be held liable for algorithmically promoting that content if it is illegal or harmful?

But that brings us back to the fundamental divide between the two parties invested in upending Section 230. They can agree that they want to roll it back. But their goals in doing that are diametrically opposed. If the parties agree to repeal Section 230 but can’t come to an agreement on what should come next, you end up with the worst of all worlds. Frankly, with this Congress and President, that seems about par for the course.",0.9813,0.049,0.839,0.111
"META Platforms, Facebook.",11 WTF Moments from the Facebook Memoir Mark Zuckerberg Doesn’t Want You to Read,'Careless People': 11 wild moments from the tell-all Facebook memoir that Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg don't want you to read.,http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/careless-people-facebook-memoir-1235299645/,2025-03-21,"Anyone miserable in their jobs will take some solace from Careless People, a blistering new memoir by Sarah Wynn-Williams, former global public policy director at Facebook (since rebranded as Meta). This tale of her years at the company, from her idealistic pitch for an international role in 2011 to her firing in 2017, charts a descent into the swamp of Silicon Valley’s narcissistic greed and frigid amorality, offering personal indictments of several executives to whom she answered, including Joel Kaplan, Sheryl Sandberg, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

In the book, Wynn-Williams details how Facebook’s managerial disputes and failures in this period, when it was rapidly expanding around the globe, had dire and fatal effects. Able to describe even her near-death by shark attack in her New Zealand childhood with frighteningly sober clarity, the former diplomat covers political scandals and workplace nightmares with zero hyperbole — only regret for continuing to believe in Facebook’s potential as signs of catastrophe grew impossible to ignore.

Meta has sought to limit the impact of Careless People, winning an emergency ruling from a U.S. arbitrator to prevent Wynn-Williams from distributing or promoting the book, which was kept a closely guarded secret until shortly before its release this month. In a statement shared with Rolling Stone, the company dismissed it as “a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives,” claiming that Wynn-Williams was “fired for poor performance and toxic behavior,” and that “an investigation at the time determined she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment.” Former Meta employees have also disputed details of the book. A representative for Sandberg, who is no longer with the company, declined to comment about how she is depicted in Careless People. Macmillan Publishers and its imprint Flatiron Books are standing behind the tell-all, which is now the New York Times number one bestseller. Editor’s picks

Here are 11 of the wildest moments from Wynn-William’s journey to the heart of Big Tech.

An Aborted Organ Drive

Early in her tenure at Facebook, Wynn-Williams writes, she sought to convince leadership to forge connections with foreign governments as it looked to grow user bases in those countries. At one point, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg decided on a global organ donation initiative, despite the overwhelming cultural, legal, and religious complexities it presented — and the fact that Facebook was hardly equipped to serve as an organ or patient registry. Wynn-Williams recalls how frustrated Sandberg became when she heard that the program would merely encourage people to sign up with local donation sites, in part because of concerns about the company enabling organ trafficking. Sandberg, according to the book, posed a bizarre rhetorical question: “Do you mean to tell me that if my four-year-old was dying and the only thing that would save her was a new kidney, that I couldn’t fly to Mexico and get one and put it in my handbag?” Wynn-Williams writes that she was forced to carefully explain, to Sandberg’s apparent displeasure, that this is indeed illegal. The initiative was radically scaled down, though Sandberg ensured that “registered as an organ donor” could appear on user pages as a “life event,” like a marriage or moving to a new city.

Hillary Clinton in a Colombian Salsa Club

One surreal scene unfolded on a trip Wynn-Williams took to Cartagena, Colombia, in 2012, with Facebook’s head of global growth, Javier Olivan. Wynn-Williams writes that she was given the unusual mission of convincing this executive to remain at the company even after he and other early employees struck it rich on an imminent IPO, and by her own admission, she didn’t really know how she might make the case for staying. But the visit for a summit among heads of state went well enough, and, after midnight one evening, she found herself partying with her coworker and some of his friends in the area, who eventually migrated from the tourist center of the city into “gritty neighborhoods” and found a “back-alley salsa club.” It was there that Olivan declared he had spotted Hillary Clinton. Wynn-Williams chalked it up to “the drinks and the excitement of the summit,” arguing, “there is no chance that the U.S. secretary of state is here.” Lo and behold, Clinton was partying, too: “Beer in hand, next to the band, dancing with a small group of her staff, security detail conspicuous with their earpieces in the steamy club.” The cabinet official was “completely caught up in the music, right in the front, clapping and swinging her hips.” Some after-hours diplomacy, it seems.

Bruising Board Games

As Facebook’s influence spread and Wynn-Williams’ role became more significant, she spent more time with Mark Zuckerberg, and writes that their office relationship could be quite awkward. At one point, Zuckerberg told her he had no interest in meeting the prime minister of New Zealand, not realizing the prime minister was standing with them. The social interactions weren’t always much better. During a tour of Asia, she writes, Zuckerberg suggested playing the strategy board game Settlers of Catan — and while everyone got into the nerdy spirit of it, Wynn-Williams began to suspect that her colleagues deliberately never went after their boss. “You’re letting him win,” she told them, but they denied it, while Zuckerberg, she writes, seemed totally oblivious. Years later, she again played board games with Zuckerberg on his private jet, and didn’t hold back, beating him twice in a row. Both times, she says, he accused her of cheating. “You had multiple ways to win,” she informed him the second time, laying out the better moves he could have made toward the end of the round. The dispute turned into a discussion of how Zuckerberg, in Wynn-Williams’ eyes, had mismanaged Facebook. “You’re so used to being the winner who takes all,” she told him.

The Casual Suggestion of Election Interference Abroad

Wynn-Williams was often shocked by the incurious nature of others at Facebook, she writes, especially what she saw as their seeming indifference to basic laws and norms abroad. After Joel Kaplan, a former White House chief of staff under George W. Bush, became her boss on the policy team, he moved aggressively to turn profits through political and electoral advertising in other countries — while, she claims, still having to be informed where certain Latin American nations were and that Taiwan is an island. Soon, Facebook was facing regulatory problems in other countries because of its election advertising. Apparently undeterred, Kaplan told Wynn-Williams that Facebook should establish political action committees around the world, she claims, only to learn from her that this is illegal. “Nobody wants foreigners bankrolling their elections,” she explained. In his surprise, she writes, he changed tack, saying, “We need to get moving on channeling money to our key allies offshore, you know, our most influential politicians in other countries.” Wynn-Williams said that this would be viewed as bribery and corruption, except perhaps by dictators, who would gladly take the money. “For a minute I worry that he’s seriously considering it,” she writes. The chapter ends there, and there’s no indication Facebook spread money around this way.

Sandberg’s Bedroom Invites

Careless People paints former Facebook chief of operations Sheryl Sandberg (who left in 2022) as prone to bursts of anger and tone-deaf self-promotion, often at odds with the feminist principles she laid out in her hit corporate advice book Lean In, and unmoved by the plight of other women working in male-dominated Silicon Valley. More strangely, however, Wynn-Williams claims that Sandberg had a habit of crossing boundaries with her female subordinates. Not only did they have to assist on matters like book tours and public appearances that fell outside their job responsibilities, she writes, but they were sometimes instructed to join Sandberg in her bed on her private jet. On a flight back to the U.S. following the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Wynn-Williams planned to spend the hours in the air working on a debrief as required by Sandberg, but the executive continued to insist — while wearing her pajamas — that she “come to bed” in the jet’s sole bedroom. Thinking that “it wouldn’t be right for a male COO to ask for this and it’s not right for a female one to,” Wynn-Williams kept refusing. She writes that Sandberg, irritated by this, said one more thing to her when the plane eventually landed in California: “You should have got into the bed.” On a later trip, Wynn-Williams claims she saw another of Sandberg’s female employees go into the bedroom with her at her request.

‘Heartwarming’ Arrest of Employee

In 2016, Diego Dzodan, a Facebook vice president in Brazil, was arrested because WhatsApp, which the company owns, wouldn’t hand over messages related to a drug trafficking case. Wynn-Williams was horrified by the situation, but Zuckerberg — charmed by Dzodan’s allegiance to him in the face of possible prosecution by a nation with strict internet laws — wanted to celebrate the moment with a Facebook post, Wynn-Williams says. He drafted several versions, she writes, originally calling it a “heartwarming story” and claiming that Dzodan was acting in order to “protect our community,” while neglecting to mention that Facebook was shielding the privacy of an accused drug trafficking organization that had threatened to assassinate the judge in the case. She says that employees also warned a stubborn Zuckerberg that such a message would sabotage their legal defense of Dzodan, which was to tell the court that WhatsApp was a distinct company, and that a Facebook vice president can’t be held responsible for its decisions. Throughout internal discussions, Wynn-Williams observes, Zuckerberg “doesn’t seem to be worried about Diego in the slightest.” Ultimately, Dzodan was released within a day, and Zuckerberg never shared his “heartwarming” update on the vice president’s brief detainment.

Patterns of Alleged Sexual Harassment and Possible Retaliation

According to Wynn-Williams, Kaplan, her former boss, asked about her breastfeeding and the effects of the amniotic fluid embolism that nearly killed her after she gave birth to her second child, and deliberately drew attention to his habit of joining their virtual meetings from his bed. She alleges that he also commented on her looks and ground against her while dancing at a corporate event. Wynn-Williams further claims that he required her to do work during her second maternity leave and subjected her to a performance review the day she formally returned to the office, complaining she wasn’t “responsive enough” during her time recovering from the difficult birth and a coma due to extensive blood loss. During an unrelated internal investigation, Wynn-Williams put some of her complaints about Kaplan on the record with company lawyers, she writes, though when the possibility of a probe into Kaplan was floated, she agreed to drop it if he would stop making her uncomfortable. But he didn’t, she claims, and Kaplan effectively demoted her after this. She writes that a subsequent investigation into his behavior cleared him of any wrongdoing — then, at Wynn-Williams’ next performance review, she was summarily fired and escorted out of the office by a security guard, she writes. Responding to a request for comment from Rolling Stone on this matter, Meta claimed that the investigation into Wynn-Williams’ harassment claims was thorough and took longer than the average case, involving a review of all the documents she provided and 17 witness interviews.

Trouble in China

Throughout Wynn-Williams’ tenure at Facebook, Zuckerberg was intent on expanding into China, where the platform was blocked. Their efforts, she writes, led to all kinds of gaffes, subterfuge, and queasy compromises. In 2015, Zuckerberg had the opportunity to shake hands with Chinese president Xi Jinping but was excluded from a closed-door meeting between Xi and other American tech CEOs. He posted a picture of himself and the back of Xi’s head anyway, making it appear that he was part of that meeting — and infuriating the Chinese government. (At a state dinner in the White House two days later, she writes, Xi declined Zuckerberg’s request to do him the honor of naming the child his wife was then carrying.) Later, Wynn-Williams was appalled at internal documents indicating the ways Facebook was evidently willing to comply with China’s censorship demands and requests for user data in exchange for being able to operate within the country someday: one memo cautioned that “Facebook employees will be responsible for user data responses that could lead to death, torture and incarceration.” In an incredibly clumsy move to penetrate the Chinese market, Facebook secretly released apps in the country through shell corporations without authorization, but supposedly with the tacit approval of China’s internet regulator. They were shut down after a New York Times story about the scheme.

Targeting Emotionally Vulnerable Kids

Careless People is unsparing in its account of how Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign gamed Facebook’s systems with misinformation and inflammatory content in the run-up to an upset election victory (and how Zuckerberg and Sandberg, in Wynn-Williams’ view, were impressed rather than alarmed by this). But the next year, Wynn-Williams writes, she discovered that the company was also courting advertisers with the option of targeting “thirteen-to-seventeen-year-olds across its platforms, including Instagram, during moments of psychological vulnerability when they feel ‘worthless,’ ‘insecure,’ ‘stressed,’ ‘defeated,’ ‘anxious,’ ‘stupid, ‘useless,’ and ‘like a failure,’” per a leaked document from a presentation to Australian brands. When the communications team considered a statement to the effect that Facebook wanted to “remedy” such practices, one member noted that they really weren’t doing anything to prevent such exploitation: users could be targeted based on emotional states, as well as racial and ethnic background. Facebook went as far as tracking when teen girls deleted selfies so that a company could “serve a beauty ad to them” right after, Wynn-Williams writes.

Employee Ignored While Having Medical Crisis

Toward the end of her time at Facebook, Wynn-Williams felt that the basic humanity of the office environment had evaporated. One day, she recounts, she heard a “commotion” and ran over to see “a woman convulsing on the floor,” foaming at the mouth and bleeding from her face as if she had hit her desk while falling. But nobody at the desks nearby helped her, instead remaining focused on their screens, she claims. She and two other people called 911, though they knew none of the information that would be useful to the dispatcher or EMTs. Wynn-Williams writes that she asked a woman “studiously concentrating on her computer” if she was the stricken woman’s manager, and she confirmed that she was, adding, “But I’m very busy.” All she said beyond that, Wynn-Williams claims, was that the ill woman was “a contractor,” that “her contract’s coming to an end soon,” and that Wynn-Williams could contact human resources for any additional information. This exchange occurred, she writes, as the woman continued to convulse.

The Myanmar Genocide

In 2013, Wynn-Williams was dispatched on a harrowing one-woman mission to Myanmar — while pregnant — to make contact with the ruling military junta and find out why they had blocked Facebook in the country. Against all odds, she was able to reach a government ministry and plead the company’s case, and soon enough, millions in the country were able to access a limited version of Facebook on their mobile phones. With that, however, came an explosion of viral hate speech and misinformation targeting the Rohingya people, a largely Muslim minority in Myanmar, which coincided with riots and the burning of mosques. Wynn-Williams claims that Facebook did not take steps to make the site compatible with the Burmese language, didn’t post their Community Standards in Burmese, failed to take down anti-Muslim slurs, blocked her attempt to hire a human rights expert in Southeast Asia to mitigate problems in the country, and, for a while, was entirely reliant on a single contractor to moderate extremist content spreading there. In 2016, following a free election that saw voters reject the junta in favor of democratic candidates, the military launched a brutal campaign against the Rohingya widely recognized as an ethnic cleansing, with thousands killed and hundreds of thousands fleeing across the border to Bangladesh. It would emerge that the junta had specifically used Facebook to inflame hate against its own Muslim population.",-0.9993,0.107,0.833,0.059

While AI-generated responses are not new—Facebook already suggests comments on profile pictures and other images—Meta is now looking to expand this feature to Instagram.

The new functionality, discovered by social media tester Jonah Manzano, aims to improve engagement in Instagram’s comment sections by assisting users in writing relevant and interactive responses. According to Manzano, Instagram is testing a feature labeled “Write with Meta AI” within the comment section of posts, allowing users to receive AI-generated comment suggestions.

Users who have access to this new tool will notice a small pencil icon within the text bar under an Instagram post. Clicking on it activates Meta AI, which then analyzes the image and generates up to three suggested comments based on its content. If users are not satisfied with the initial suggestions, they can request alternative options.

Short video how it works pic.twitter.com/WdVOxcumZa — Jonah Manzano (@jonah_manzano) March 15, 2025

A Meta spokesperson confirmed the testing phase, emphasizing that AI is being integrated into multiple aspects of the platform beyond just direct messaging. According to the company, AI-powered features are also being tested in comments, feeds, groups, and searches to enhance the overall user experience.

“We regularly test new ways for users to engage with Meta AI across our apps. Beyond DMs, you’ll find Meta AI assisting in comments, feeds, groups, and search to make your experiences more engaging and useful.”

This move aligns with Meta’s broader strategy to integrate AI across its social media ecosystem, ensuring users have a more interactive and seamless experience. By leveraging AI to suggest meaningful responses, the company hopes to foster better engagement and encourage more dynamic conversations in comment sections.

The feature could also benefit brands, influencers, and casual users by streamlining responses, saving time, and reducing the effort needed to craft engaging comments. However, it remains to be seen how the AI-generated responses will be received by users and whether they will enhance or diminish the authenticity of social media interactions.

Meta has not yet announced when or if this feature will be widely available, but the testing phase suggests a growing focus on AI-powered enhancements across its platforms.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Sarah Wynn-Williams published a memoir of her time working in global policy at Meta (then called Facebook) that gave a deeply unflattering portrayal of the company and its executives.

Ahead of its March 11 release, Meta filed an emergency motion with an arbitrator. The judge ruled that Wynn-Williams had likely violated her non-disparagement agreement with the company and had to stop promoting or selling the book. (The publisher pointed out that the arbitration ruling did not affect it, and the book is currently for sale.)

Last week, I speculated that Meta's move was backfiring: it set off a new wave of headlines and drew even more attention. Come on, who wouldn't want to check out the book Mark Zuckerberg doesn't want you to read?

My theory has since gained credence. The book just debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Bestseller list for nonfiction. It also ranks fifth on Amazon's bestseller list.

Just before the ruling, Business Insider's Pranav Dixit interviewed Wynn-Williams. She doesn't appear to have conducted an interview since.

Typically, nonfiction books are announced months, more often years in advance, and review copies are sent long before the release to drum up publicity. This one abruptly burst into existence — announced less than a week before its release. But it appears the incredibly brief promotional window didn't hurt sales.

I should note here that the book is not without controversy (I suppose that's obvious). Meta has feverishly denounced its contents, dismissing it in their official statement as the work of a disgruntled employee who was fired for ""toxic behavior"" and poor performance. Meta has also said it wasn't fact-checked (an irony lost on no one, given the company's recent changes to fact-checking on its own platforms).

Andrew Bosworth, CTO of Meta, said on Threads that the book is ""full of lies. Literally stories that did not happen."" Other current and former Meta employees posted on social media that the book doesn't reflect the Meta they knew. Katie Harbath, who overlapped with Wynn-Williams and was present for some of the things that happened during the period of 2011-2017 that the book covers, wrote a blog post about how it contains inaccuracies that undermine its larger point. She wrote:

Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know

But when the facts are wrong, the conclusions people draw are flawed, too. The company's real failures deserve scrutiny. Exaggerations, omissions, and distortions only muddy the conversation.

However, at least one former Meta employee has supported the book, writing on her public LinkedIn that it feels true to her experience.

Here's my opinion, having read the book: Ask any two coworkers what their experience at a company was a decade ago, and I promise you'll get different answers. And in a memoir written years later, yes, details and conversations could be misremembered.

But it's a forest-for-the-trees thing. The most damning moments in the book had already been reported in the news (Meta's PR dedicated an entire page on its website to point out that the book is full of ""old news""). No one on Earth, not even Mark Zuckerberg and his new philosophy of not apologizing for world events out of his control, would look at Facebook in the 2010s and not agree that mistakes were made — some of them quite serious. You already know that, we all already know that. What the book offers is a glimpse inside the rooms where those decisions were made. That's compelling.

Whether Meta's attempt to quash the book by enforcing a non-disparagement clause was another one of those mistakes? Well, I suppose soon we can argue it out in the Community Notes.",-0.916,0.078,0.856,0.066

Meta AI was first introduced in the United States in 2023, aiming to provide users with an intelligent conversational assistant capable of brainstorming ideas, planning trips, and answering questions using real-time web information. The initial rollout showcased Meta's ambition to integrate advanced AI capabilities across its suite of social media platforms.

The European launch faced significant delays due to regulatory concerns. In 2024, Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), where Meta's European headquarters are located, requested the company to suspend the use of European user data in training its AI models. This move was driven by apprehensions regarding data privacy and the potential misuse of user-generated content. Consequently, Meta halted the rollout of its multimodal Llama AI model in the European Union, citing the unpredictable nature of the European regulatory environment. The company emphasized that without local information, the AI's performance would be compromised, leading to a subpar user experience.

With the recent rollout, European users can engage with Meta AI through text-based interactions. The assistant can help brainstorm ideas, plan trips, or answer specific questions by leveraging information from the web. Notably, the AI model deployed in Europe has not been trained on first-party data from EU users, addressing some of the privacy concerns previously raised by regulators.

However, certain functionalities available in other regions remain absent in Europe:

Image Generation and Editing: Users cannot use Meta AI to generate or edit images, a feature accessible in the U.S. version.

Users cannot use Meta AI to generate or edit images, a feature accessible in the U.S. version. Multimodal Interactions: The ability to ask questions about photos or use voice inputs is currently unavailable.

These limitations underscore Meta's cautious approach in aligning with European data protection standards.

Meta has engaged extensively with European regulators over the past year to ensure compliance with regional data protection laws. Ellie Heatrick, a spokesperson for Meta, stated, ""This launch follows almost a year of intensive engagement with various European regulators, and for now, we are only offering a text-only model in the region which wasn't trained on first-party data from users in the EU.""

The company plans to work collaboratively with regulators to expand Meta AI's features in Europe, aiming to achieve parity with the U.S. version over time. This phased approach reflects Meta's strategy to balance innovation with regulatory compliance, ensuring that users in Europe can eventually access the full suite of AI capabilities without compromising on privacy and data protection.

The introduction of Meta AI in Europe positions Meta alongside other tech giants offering AI-driven assistants, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. While some users express excitement about the new features, others remain cautious due to past concerns over data privacy. The limited functionality at launch may also influence user adoption rates, as European users await the rollout of more advanced features.

In conclusion, Meta's strategic rollout of its AI assistant in Europe marks a significant step in the company's global AI ambitions. By addressing regulatory concerns and prioritizing user privacy, Meta aims to integrate advanced AI functionalities into its platforms, enhancing user experience while adhering to regional data protection standards.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",The EU is betraying its users and weakening their privacy for political gain,"Maybe Apple will never fully walk away from Europe, but the European Commission has just guaranteed that the citizens of its member states will always be the last to get new iPhone features — if they get them at all.Apple's headquarters in Ireland, in the Eur…",https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/03/19/the-eu-is-betraying-its-users-and-weakening-their-privacy-for-political-gain,2025-03-19,"Maybe Apple will never fully walk away from Europe, but the European Commission has just guaranteed that the citizens of its member states will always be the last to get new iPhone features — if they get them at all.

Even before its latest legal requirements, the European Commission (EC) has already put Apple in the position of keeping iPhone mirroring away from Europe, and delaying Apple Intelligence. But it's only going to get worse — and this is entirely the European Commission's fault.

Under the banner of protecting consumer and business interests, the EC has made it so that any firm would drop Europe to the bottom of its list of priorities.

But then of course, the new requirements do not apply to just any firm, they solely apply to Apple. They don't even apply to any other company that ostensibly falls under exactly the same Digital Markets Act (DMA) definition of a gatekeeper firm.

""The DMA regulates the actions of so-called gatekeepers,"" says the European Commission in its Q&A addition to the new stipulations. ""Gatekeepers are large online platforms that have been designated as such because they provide services — so called core platform services — to many European users.""

""The DMA lays down rules to ensure contestability and fairness for business users and end users,"" it continues. ""This includes an obligation on gatekeepers of operating systems to provide, free of charge, effective interoperability with the same hardware and software features available to services provided by the gatekeeper itself.""

Fine words, but incredibly they are not actually true words. Despite all the EC says, there are no such obligations on any gatekeeper, except Apple.

It's not as if Apple is some saintly organization. Look at its record with unions, or look at how it appears to Sherlock developers.

But the EC's new stipulations have nothing to do with Apple's actions, and have very little to do with fairness for consumers or businesses. They are about politics and the truly shocking gullibility of people who appear to believe whoever they spoke to last.

""The specified measures are based on extensive technical discussions between the Commission, Apple and numerous interested stakeholders, in particular developers,"" says the EC. ""The measures take into account feedback received from third parties on the importance of interoperability for certain iOS features and on Apple's handling of interoperability requests.""

""This constructive dialogue allowed the Commission to identify the measures that developers need to offer innovative products and services,"" it continues, ""while ensuring that end users maintain their known iPhone user experience and enjoy improved interoperability.""

Except it doesn't ensure that. It does the opposite of ensuring any of this.

By requiring Apple to provide interoperability on day one of any new feature or technology, it might as well be trying to ensure that there won't be a day one for users in Europe.

Apple will surely block more new features in the EU

Instead, as it has done before, Apple will roll out new features everywhere else in the world. And then, maybe turn to doing all of the extra work that the EC mandates.

Even if Apple delays features for the EU, its rivals operating within Europe could just wait until they can legally take what they want and apply it worldwide.

iPhone Mirroring in use in the US, but not in the EU

Apple has complained that there are already companies that solely copy Apple's technology. But now the EC is requiring Apple to give it to them, and do so for free.

By demanding that rivals get the same features at the same time as Apple, the EC is also forcing the company to delay introducing its own features to its own products.

The only way Apple can avoid having its intellectual property taken by anyone who wants it, is to not deploy that IP within the EU.

What the EC does and what it says it does

Both Apple and the EC say that they have worked together, but perhaps no one involved the Commission's communications department. There is a total disconnect between what the EC says it is doing, and what it is actually achieving.

For instance, the EC announcement quite grandly states that the obligations also encourage ""the gatekeepers to innovate its [sic] platform and its own products and services."" Note the singular ""its"" about Apple after the pretense of referring to gatekeeper firms, plural.

Plus, you can say it all you like, but what the EC has done must mean that Apple will at least slow down developing its offerings within the EU.

There is also an argument that the very same stipulations will curtail innovation from Apple's rivals. If all you have to do is ask Apple for a freebie, there's no incentive to invest money and time figuring out anything yourself.

So without question, EU users will become second-rate citizens as far as Apple devices and apps are concerned. Without much doubt, rival firms will cut back on their own research and development expecting government-mandated handouts from Apple, making the situation worse.

Making privacy and security impossible

But at least EU citizens will be protected — except, they won't. Rivals are now allowed to ask for access to pretty much anything they like on the iPhone, and presumably Apple has to have very good reason to refuse it.

Whereas it appears that rivals do not have to offer any reason at all for why they want certain access. As Apple points out, Meta has already requested access to more than a dozen privacy-sensitive technologies to do with CarPlay, iPhone mirroring, or devices connected via Bluetooth.

The EU must know this, but it doesn't appear to have asked Meta why, for one single example, it wants access to an iPhone user's Wi-Fi network details. There is no benefit at all to a Facebook user of surrendering this information.

Whereas there potentially is a lot of profit for Meta in being able to determine where a user is now, where they go to work, and where they shop.

You'd have thought that if the EC cared about consumers, it would care about their privacy. You would have thought that if the EC institutes legal requirements against gatekeeper companies, that it would apply these stipulations to all of them.

It's not like there are all that many. Currently there are six — and Facebook/Meta is one of them. The others are:

Alphabet/Google

Amazon

Microsoft

ByteDance

There's a perhaps surprising, perhaps not, lack of European companies on this list. Spotify should be on it, for instance.

What happens next

The European Union could be admired for how it has implemented regulations controlling Big Tech where practically the rest of the world is just talking about it a lot. But what the EC has now demonstrated is that this is not about controlling Big Tech for the benefit of its citizens.

As Tim Cook once, and quite uncharacteristically, said of the EU and Ireland's tax dispute, this is all ""total political crap.""

The thing with politics is that it comes with righteous and grandiose claims, usually accompanied with politicians wrapping themselves in the appropriately-colored flag, but then a collapse under pressure. And of those six gatekeeper firms, five of them are American, so it's not likely that laws letting rivals walk away with technology is going to go uncontested by these companies with armies of lawyers, and funding in equal measure.

It may even become contested within the EU itself. For in mid-2026, Ireland takes over the presidency of the Union, and Tim Cook has already said that will be ""a significant milestone.""

So, we'll see in time how this develops. In the short-term, though, the law appears to be a clumsy effort at attacking US big tech, with no gain for anybody but politicians and losses for everybody else.",0.9963,0.062,0.833,0.105
"META Platforms, Facebook.","FTC Removes Posts Critical of Amazon, Microsoft, and AI Companies",Business-guidance content published during the Biden administration has been removed from the Federal Trade Commission website.,https://www.wired.com/story/federal-trade-commission-removed-blogs-critical-of-ai-amazon-microsoft/,2025-03-18,"The Trump administration’s Federal Trade Commission has removed four years’ worth of business guidance blogs as of Tuesday morning, including important consumer protection information related to artificial intelligence and the agency’s landmark privacy lawsuits under former chair Lina Khan against companies like Amazon and Microsoft. More than 300 blogs were removed.

On the FTC’s website, the page hosting all of the agency’s business-related blogs and guidance no longer includes any information published during former president Joe Biden’s administration, current and former FTC employees, who spoke under anonymity for fear of retaliation, tell WIRED. These blogs contained advice from the FTC on how big tech companies could avoid violating consumer protection laws.

One now deleted blog, titled “Hey, Alexa! What are you doing with my data?” explains how, according to two FTC complaints, Amazon and its Ring security camera products allegedly leveraged sensitive consumer data to train the ecommerce giant’s algorithms. (Amazon disagreed with the FTC’s claims.) It also provided guidance for companies operating similar products and services. Another post titled “$20 million FTC settlement addresses Microsoft Xbox illegal collection of kids’ data: A game changer for COPPA compliance” instructs tech companies on how to abide by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act by using the 2023 Microsoft settlement as an example. The settlement followed allegations by the FTC that Microsoft obtained data from children using Xbox systems without the consent of their parents or guardians.

“In terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,” a source familiar tells WIRED.

Another removed FTC blog titled “The Luring Test: AI and the engineering of consumer trust” outlines how businesses could avoid creating chatbots that violate the FTC Act’s rules against unfair or deceptive products. This blog won an award in 2023 for “excellent descriptions of artificial intelligence.”

The Trump administration has received broad support from the tech industry. Big tech companies like Amazon and Meta, as well as tech entrepreneurs like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, all donated to Trump’s inauguration fund. Other Silicon Valley leaders, like Elon Musk and David Sacks, are officially advising the administration. Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employs technologists sourced from Musk’s tech companies. And already, federal agencies like the General Services Administration have started to roll out AI products like GSAi, a general-purpose government chatbot.

The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.

Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at makenakelly.32.

Removing blogs raises serious compliance concerns under the Federal Records Act and the Open Government Data Act, one former FTC official tells WIRED. During the Biden administration, FTC leadership would place “warning” labels above previous administrations’ public decisions it no longer agreed with, the source said, fearing that removal would violate the law.

Since President Donald Trump designated Andrew Ferguson to replace Khan as FTC chair in January, the Republican regulator has vowed to leverage his authority to go after big tech companies. Unlike Khan, however, Ferguson’s criticisms center around the Republican party’s long-standing allegations that social media platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, censor conservative speech online. Before being selected as chair, Ferguson told Trump that his vision for the agency also included rolling back Biden-era regulations on artificial intelligence and tougher merger standards, The New York Times reported in December.

In an interview with CNBC last week, Ferguson argued that content moderation could equate to an antitrust violation. “If companies are degrading their product quality by kicking people off because they hold particular views, that could be an indication that there's a competition problem,” he said.

Sources speaking with WIRED on Tuesday claimed that tech companies are the only groups who benefit from the removal of these blogs.

“They are talking a big game on censorship. But at the end of the day, the thing that really hits these companies’ bottom line is what data they can collect, how they can use that data, whether they can train their AI models on that data, and if this administration is planning to take the foot off the gas there while stepping up its work on censorship,” the source familiar alleges. “I think that's a change big tech would be very happy with.”",0.8773,0.051,0.878,0.071
"META Platforms, Facebook.",Snap CEO Evan Spiegel explains his joke job title on LinkedIn,Snap CEO Evan Spiegel's LinkedIn briefly said he was a product VP at Meta. He explained to Bloomberg what was behind the post.,https://www.businessinsider.com/snap-evan-spiegel-linkedin-meta-product-vp-copycat-features-2025-3,2025-03-18,"This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Evan Spiegel doesn't work at Meta, but if you're looking at his LinkedIn, you might have thought he did.

The Snap cofounder and CEO said in an interview with Bloomberg published Monday that one of his employees temporarily put on his profile that he was ""VP Product @ Meta"" as a gag. (His LinkedIn profile no longer shows that.)

The joke appears to be a dig at Meta, which has taken a few pages from Snapchat's book over the years when it comes to features.

For example, Snapchat was the first to introduce user Stories that disappear after a while, rolling out a feature in 2013 that let users post photos and videos that'd vanish after 24 hours.

Meta in 2016 unveiled its own Stories feature on Instagram, and Facebook got them the following year. WhatsApp debuted a similar feature called Status also in 2017.

Facebook offered to buy Snapchat for $3 billion in 2013, but Spiegel's company declined. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg reached out to Spiegel in 2016 to try again.

Zuckerberg has been asked about the striking similarities between some of the companies' offerings before.

In a 2017 earnings call, he talked about what was at the time called Facebook's Camera Effects Platform.

""I think we were a little bit late to the trend initially around making cameras the center of how sharing works,"" he said. ""But I do think at this point we're pretty much ahead in terms of the technology that we're building, and making an open platform, I think, is a big step forward. A lot of people are using these products across our family of apps. And I would expect us to continue leading the way forward on this from this point on.""

Snapchat had previously unveiled animated AR selfie masks and filters.

More recently, Snapchat showed off its newest AR glasses, called Spectacles, last year, days before Zuckerberg announced Meta's competing Orion glasses.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",The Anti-DEI Agenda Is Reprogramming America,President Trump’s anti-DEI playbook doesn’t just affect the makeup of America’s workplaces. It also impacts cultural production. Just ask Netflix’s former head of diversity.,https://www.wired.com/story/anti-dei-agenda-reprogramming-america/,2025-03-17,"It would be silly to think, in this time of spectacular fools, that the Donald Trump administration mandate to kill diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs was simply a workplace issue. What’s happening is bigger than that, says Vernā Myers, and it will have implications for years to come. The US government has declared war on American culture.

The removal of DEI efforts doesn’t just impact the workforces at specific companies, it also impacts what those companies produce, their cultural output. Removing diversity programs limits the voices present when decisions are made about features on social media platforms or what TV show to make. But for Myers, a longtime consultant and cultural strategist who served as Netflix’s vice president of inclusion strategy from 2018 to 2023, the administration’s anti-DEI agenda is “not about how DEI is practiced.”

“This is about the principles of equality and inclusion for all,” Myers says. “This is, ‘We are going to take down the structure of values that DEI is associated with, and by doing so we are going to pull back your civil rights.’”

Trump made a target of DEI on day one, signing an executive order to end “radical and wasteful” preferencing in federal agencies. He followed that up with another order aimed squarely at DEI programs in the private sector. His attorney general Pam Bondi has called for investigations into companies that uphold DEI standards.

A federal judge subsequently blocked Trump’s DEI orders, but that hasn’t stopped companies from scaling back on their initiatives. Warner Bros. Discovery changed the title of its DEI program to simply “Inclusion.” Paramount put a stop to several policies. Disney changed the diversity and inclusion factors it used to determine executive compensation. Per a report in Axios, the company also altered some of the content advisory disclaimers that ran before older titles on Disney+.

Companies like Meta, meanwhile, were eager to embrace a corporate culture of “masculine energy,” because it aligns with the Trump administration’s “warrior” ethos. It also preemptively ditched its third-party fact-checking program and paid moderators in favor of a system that is similar to Community Notes on X. The move, coupled with changes to its Community Guidelines, has exposed users across Facebook, Threads, and Instagram to more hate speech and abuse.

In Hollywood, there is a shift happening, a move toward programming geared to Trump’s America. Law-and-order shows are making a comeback (Prime Video’s On Call; A+E’s Ozark Law) as broadcast-style TV slowly reasserts its dominance. Even the first breakout show of the year—Paradise on Hulu—is all about keeping order in a world ripped apart by nuclear warfare and climate disaster. Rolling back the studios’ diversity initiatives will likely only ensure this continues.

Last month, Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr, a Trump loyalist who previously said he would end the agency’s DEI efforts if appointed, opened a probe into NBC parent company Comcast, promising to take action against the telecom giant if it found “any programs that promote invidious forms of DEI.”",-0.4385,0.065,0.874,0.061

Bluesky is taking another shot at the Mark Zuckerbergs of the tech world.

During the week of SXSW in Austin, Bluesky CEO Jay Graber donned a black T-shirt imprinted with a Latin phrase: ""Mundus sine caesaribus"" or ""A world without Ceasars.""

The shirt appeared to reference the Meta CEO, who wore a similar boxy, black T-shirt with a Latin phrase likening himself to Roman general Julius Caesar: ""Aut Zuck aut nihil"" or ""Either Zuck or nothing.""

On Thursday afternoon, Bluesky started slinging the same shirt Graber wore at the Austin conference. The shirt sold out within 30 minutes, according to Bluesky spokesperson Emily Liu.

Liu told BI that the shirt signaled the ethos of the social media platform.

""Jay wore the shirt onstage at SXSW to emphasize Bluesky's democratic approach, where a single CEO or company doesn't control your experience online — and looks like people resonated with that vision,"" Liu said in an email.

Graber said in a Bluesky post that sales of the shirt launched while she was on a flight and sold out before she landed.

The company declined to share how many shirts it sold.

Since Twitter rebranded to X after Elon Musk's 2022 takeover, some users have decamped to alternative social media platforms like Bluesky. Meta, the parent company of social platforms Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram, launched its X alternative, Threads, in 2023.

The migration continues a trend of online users seeking sites that conform closer to their political or cultural beliefs.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Meta to test ‘Community Notes’ using algorithm from Elon Musk’s X,Tech giant says it expects new feature to be 'less biased' than previous third-party fact-checking program.,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/3/14/meta-to-test-community-notes-using-algorithm-from-elon-musks-x,2025-03-14,"Tech giant says it expects new feature to be ‘less biased’ than previous third-party fact-checking program.

Meta has said that its “Community Notes” feature intended to replace third-party fact checkers will use the open-source algorithm developed by Elon Musk’s X.

Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg announced the moderation shake-up in January amid a flurry of moves by Big Tech to ingratiate itself with United States President Donald Trump’s administration.

The move followed years of accusations by conservatives that fact-checking efforts often labelled legitimate viewpoints as misinformation for political or ideological reasons.

While Meta’s announcement was welcomed by Trump and many conservatives, misinformation scholars warned that the move would add to the tidal wave of false claims and fake news online.

In a blog post on Thursday, Meta said that using X’s technology for the crowdsourced fact-checking tool would allow it to “improve it for our own platforms over time”.

“As our own version develops, we may explore different or adjusted algorithms to support how Community Notes are ranked and rated,” Meta said.

“We’re building this in the open while learning from contributors and seeing how it works in practice in our products. We don’t expect this process to be perfect but we’ll continue to improve as we learn.”

Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, said that it would begin testing the feature on March 18 and that 200,000 potential contributors had signed up so far to help assess the accuracy of content on its platforms.

The California-based tech giant said notes would not be published unless they are deemed accurate by contributors with a diverse range of viewpoints.

“We expect Community Notes to be less biased than the third party fact checking program it replaces, and to operate at a greater scale when it is fully up and running,” Meta said.

“When we launched the fact checking program in 2016, we were clear that we didn’t want to be the arbiters of truth and believed that turning to expert fact checking organizations was the best solution available.”

Meta said the new feature will be rolled out across the US after beta testing and it plans to eventually introduce the feature for all users worldwide.",0.9854,0.027,0.867,0.106

The community-driven feature replaced the company’s biased left-wing “fact checking” system that was used to censor conservatives over the past 10 years.

On Tuesday, Meta will begin releasing its own version of X’s “Community Notes” feature on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads for U.S. users, according to a report by TechCrunch.

Instead of relying on biased, third party so-called “fact-checkers,” a Community Notes feature allows social media users to add additional context to a post that might be misleading or contain wrong information.

That way, the public is entrusted to discuss issues and figure things out for themselves, rather than a third-party “fact-checker” outright banning or censoring content — which in practice was used to censor conservatives.

Notably, Elon Musk’s X has been relying on this type of crowd-sourcing of information as the social media platform’s sole means for correcting information since the SpaceX CEO bought the company.

And that method has apparently worked out well, as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is now seeking to emulate X’s Community Notes on his social media platforms.

As Breitbart News reported, Meta announced three weeks ago that social media users could sign up to be a part of the Community Notes system on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.

This came after the company scrapped its third-party “fact checking” system, with Zuckerberg himself saying they “have just been too politically biased, and have destroyed more trust than they’ve created, especially in the U.S.”

“The recent elections feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech,” the Meta CEO said in a video posted to his Instagram account earlier this year, adding that his company will therefore be “restoring free expression on our platforms.”

“We’re going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with Community Notes, similar to X,” Zuckerberg revealed.

The numbers are staggering, but what do they really mean?

Digiday has sifted through the data to find the numbers that actually matter. Here’s what you need to know:

YouTube has become huge

Over the past 20 years, YouTube has cemented itself as one of the most dominant platforms in the digital landscape. Launched in 2005, the same year as Reddit and just a year after Facebook, it emerged at a time when social media was still a novelty.

Fast forward to 2025, and YouTube is a content powerhouse. Every minute, an average of 500 hours of video is uploaded, according to the platform. A growing share of that (35%) is in 4k resolution, a trend YouTube actively encourages, especially as more people watch on TV screens.

YouTube reaches over 100 countries in 80 different languages. In several EMEA markets, for example, the majority of watch time comes from international audiences — more than 70% of YouTube viewing in the U.K., Spain and Nigeria happens outside of those countries.

It shows that language barriers are becoming less of an issue on the platform. AI-powered dubbing technology is reshaping how users consume content, with watch time increasing by 40% when viewers opt for dubbed videos.

Like other platforms, YouTube’s success relies on its algorithm. When the company introduced its first recommendation engine in 2008, it simply prioritized popular videos. Today, the system is far more sophisticated, leveraging over 80 billion signals to match users with content they’re most likely to engage with.

YouTube considers itself to be the new television

This narrative isn’t new, but it’s certainly something YouTube is proudly shouting about, especially after Nielsen ranked it as the No. 1 streaming platform in the U.S. for 12 consecutive months when it comes to watch time. Nielsen’s report, which came out in February 2024, revealed that YouTube took an average of 9.2% of total TV usage, ahead of other major streamers including Netflix (8.2%), Amazon Prime (3.5%) and Disney+ (2%). YouTube has since backed that status up with its claim that more than 1 billion hours of YouTube content are watched daily on TV screens in the U.S.

When YouTube launched in 2005, the platform had about 30,000 viewers a day. But today, the streaming giant boasts more than 2 billion daily active users and over 1 billion monthly podcast users.

And it’s not just YouTube’s long-form content that is watched on TV screens. Despite Shorts being a vertical video format, 15% of Shorts videos are now watched in the living room.

YouTube is still king when it comes to creator monetization

Most platforms keep their revenue sharing deals and creator fund participation numbers under wraps, but YouTube takes a different approach.

Currently, YouTube’s Partner Program (YPP), which is a well-established revenue share program, has 3 million creators. And 500,000 of those have been on YouTube for more than a decade.

YouTube is doing pretty well when it comes to subscriptions

Subscriptions are often seen as an alternative revenue stream so platforms don’t have to be solely reliant on ad dollars, but making subscriptions a sustainable business remains a challenge for many, from Meta to X.

But for YouTube, since introducing its Premium and Music subscription plans in 2014 and 2015 respectively, the platform has been able to reach 125 million global subscribers so far, including trials.

YouTube impacts the economy, and its got creators to thank for that

Twenty years ago, being a creator was considered more of a hobby alongside school or a full-time job, rather than a real career.

That’s no longer the case. With Europe’s creator economy projected to reach $41.17 billion by 2030 and U.S. influencer marketing expected to grow 14.2% to $9.29 billion this year, according to eMarketer, it’s clear why YouTube is focused on staying ahead in the creator space.

Part of that plan involves doubling down on YouTube’s ability to thrust creators into the cultural mainstream. Which is why the platform has said that creators are becoming the startups of Hollywood. Whether it’s scripting, editing behind the scenes or creators are hiring various staff as part of their new business — YouTube wants to be the launchpad.

As such, YouTube contributed more than $45 billion to the U.S. GDP in 2023, according to Oxford Economics, and it created more than 430,000 full-time jobs.

Similarly, in Europe, YouTube contributed €6.4 billion ($6.94 billion) to the EU’s GDP in 2023, according to the platform’s latest Impact report, not including the jobs created by the 100,000 creators in the region that have built their own businesses including hiring staff.",0.9979,0.003,0.884,0.113
