"META Platforms, Facebook.",Traffic referrals from Threads surge for some publishers this year,"Social referral traffic is ticking up this year, and some publishers are seeing surges in referrals from Threads specifically.",http://digiday.com/media/traffic-referrals-from-threads-surge-for-some-publishers-this-year/,2025-03-24,"“Social as an audience driver is back.”

That’s what Josh Awtry, svp of audience development at Newsweek, told Digiday after last Wednesday, when the publisher saw the most social referral traffic to its site on a single day in five years.

Newsweek’s social referrals from all platforms are up almost 10 times compared to the average day in March last year, Awtry said. Social made up less than 3% of Newsweek’s traffic mix at this time a year ago. But this month, social referral traffic has more than doubled as a percentage of the overall referral mix — and close to tripled over the past week, according to Awtry.

Newsweek’s referral traffic from Threads has surged 20-fold since January. Before then it had been just a few thousand daily page views, he said. Threads now drives more traffic for the publisher than X, despite it having a fraction of the follower count on the former — Newsweek has 3.5 million followers on X compared to 160,000 followers on Threads, which Meta launched in July 2023. Engagement on Threads has also increased, he added.

So what’s driving all of this? Meta-owned platforms. Yes, you read that right. Meta hasn’t exactly been a best friend to publishers lately (or even just an acquaintance). Meta has pretty much turned its back on publishers — shutting down its News tab last year, removing Instant Articles in 2023 and overhauling its algorithm in 2018 to de-prioritize content shared by publishers (and essentially tanking their Facebook referral traffic).

But Meta announced it would start getting friendlier with publishers this past January, specifically those publishing political news. In 2021, Meta decided to reduce the visibility of posts about elections, politics and social issues, but since the beginning of this year, that content has been phased back into Meta’s social feeds.

Historically, Newsweek has generated “very little” readership from Threads, Awtry said. But since Meta’s January announcement, the publisher started posting more often on the platform — up to multiple times an hour.

Meta has recently added new features to Threads that help users control and personalize their experiences, such as adding topics to bios and improved topic tagging, according to an update from the company last week. It noted that posts with tagged topics receive more views. Meta plans to announce more features, which it claims will be useful for publishers on Threads, according to a spokesperson.

Newsweek isn’t the only publisher experiencing these gains. Politico had the most referrals from Threads to date in February. March referrals are up almost 50% month over month, according to a spokesperson from the publisher.

Forbes started putting a lot more effort into Threads and posting more as its stories began gaining traffic in January, and, as a result, referral traffic is now up 711% year to date, according to Kerry Lauerman, executive editor at Forbes. Forbes now posts on the platform at least once an hour, more than double what the publisher was posting in December, Lauerman said.

And that’s where the “chicken and the egg” situation comes in, according to an executive at another publisher, who asked to speak anonymously. They said their referral traffic on Threads was up 677% month over month at the beginning of March. This publisher started seeing more referral traffic coming from Threads in January and upped its posts on the platform. Now it posts on Threads hundreds of times a day.

“There are so few places that right now we’re seeing that sort of acceleration in referrals,” the exec added. Threads is now bringing in more referral traffic than channels like Reddit and MSN, and is on par with platforms like NewsNow, NewsBreak and Bing, according to the exec.

The executives interviewed for this story said they’re seeing a range of topics and post types perform well on Threads — including images and link posts that span across a variety of coverage areas, including news and entertainment.

For what it’s worth, Threads is making big gains in monthly active app users. Threads had 46.5 million monthly active app users in the U.S. in February, up 143% year over year, according to Similarweb data. (X had 56.2 million.) Meta said in January that Threads had more than 320 million monthly active users.

Chartbeat data also shows that, on average, Threads referral traffic to publishers has doubled in the past six months. But it still makes up less than 1% of referral traffic for publishers in aggregate.

But not all publishers have seen a bump in referral traffic from Threads — not even all news publishers. Publishers like The Guardian, The Boston Globe and three other news organizations that asked not to be named said they hadn’t seen any major shifts in Threads referral traffic.

The jury’s still out on how meaningful this traffic is to publishers’ overall audience ambitions and revenue. Referrals from Threads remain a tiny portion of publishers’ overall traffic — even if the channel is growing. Social makes up less than 10% of Newsweek’s overall referral traffic, Awtry said. The anonymous publishing exec said Threads referrals are just a single-digit share of its overall referral traffic mix.

While traffic spikes help bring in more readers to publishers’ sites (though let’s face it, they will likely be short-lived once there’s another inevitable algorithm tweak), they’re unlikely to excite too many chief commercial officers focused on daily audience in terms of how much digital ad revenue they’ll actually bring in.

“Threads remains small compared to other sources, so growth should be viewed within that context. As such, we will continue to monitor growth, and experiment accordingly,” the Politico spokesperson said.

One thing is clear: The time when publishers could rely on continuous traffic surges from Meta referrals is over. But those who are seeing lifts from Threads are happy to ride the current wave, no matter how long it lasts. Despite these improvements in referral traffic from Meta’s platforms (for some), none of those interviewed for this story said they would be pouring resources into Threads to keep the momentum going.

“The goal is ultimately to bring more discussion back to our own channels. We are going to lean hard into Threads as a page view driver but I also don’t want to fall into the same traps that we all fell into in 2018,” Awtry said. “If we’re going to invest more resources or grow our social team’s presence, it’s going to be around engagement on our own channels.”",0.9991,0.004,0.884,0.111

Snap CEO Evan Spiegel says creativity starts with failure — and he makes sure new hires get there quickly.

Snap's new designers are asked to present an idea on their first day despite having little context or time to prepare, Spiegel said on a recent episode of ""The Diary of a CEO"" podcast.

""When you have no context for what the company is working on, no idea what's going on, how on earth are you supposed to come up with a great idea? I mean, it's almost impossible,"" Spiegel said.



""So your worst fear has come true — we're all sitting there, looking at an idea that's ultimately not that great.""

First days can be nerve-racking enough without being asked to make an ill-prepared presentation to your new colleagues. But for Spiegel, that early failure is precisely the point.



By forcing new hires to showcase an idea with no preparation, context, or background, Spiegel believes the worst fears around failure evaporate early, leaving employees creatively liberated.

""Ninety-nine percent of ideas are not good — but 1% is,"" he said. ""And the best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas.""

Ultimately, Spiegel said, ""All feedback is good feedback. What you do with it is what matters.""

Spiegel credits Snap's creativity to its culture of constant experimentation more than a decade after its launch.

Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, famously introduced disappearing photos and videos and became known for introducing features like Stories, which were later copied by platforms including Instagram and Facebook.

Spiegel's LinkedIn profile recently poked fun at this, describing him as ""VP Product @ Meta"" — a gag an employee was behind, he told Bloomberg.

Spiegel founded Snapchat while studying at Stanford and became the world's youngest billionaire at 25.

Snap completed a 2017 IPO with a valuation of about $24 billion. Its market cap now stands at $15.65 billion. The company famously turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Mark Zuckerberg's Meta — then Facebook — in 2013.

Spiegel also pushed back on perfectionism in startup culture. ""People who think the game is to have the perfect idea — those are people who've never built a business before,"" he added.",0.8672,0.083,0.817,0.101

The pace at which these platforms evolve means staying ahead of the curve is no longer optional — it’s essential for any brand that wants to make an impact. Are you prepared to stay ahead in your social media strategy? Here are the trends you’ll want to watch out for in the coming year.

Short-Form Video Domination

Short-form video will continue to dominate in 2025, with platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts leading the charge. These bite-sized videos are proven to capture attention and drive engagement, making them essential for brand storytelling.

Marketers will likely double down on short-form video content, optimizing it for mobile-first audiences. In 2025, interactive elements like polls, shopping features, and live videos within short-form content will become more common, offering users a more immersive and interactive experience.

AI-Driven Content Creation

Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a buzzword — it’s reshaping the way content is created, shared, and consumed. In 2025, we can expect to see AI-powered tools used more widely for content generation, from automated captions and posts to personalized video creation.

Platforms like Instagram and TikTok are already experimenting with AI-driven content suggestions. AI can study user behavior to craft tailored content that speaks directly to each person, resulting in higher engagement and improved conversion rates.

Businesses will likely adopt AI tools to streamline content production and create hyper-targeted campaigns, ensuring content feels more authentic and relevant to users.

Social Commerce Expansion

Social commerce — shopping directly through social media platforms — will be a massive trend in 2025. While Instagram and Facebook already offer built-in shopping features, expect this trend to expand further as more platforms integrate ecommerce capabilities.

As social commerce grows, influencers and brands will increasingly turn social media into a seamless shopping experience, allowing users to go from discovering products to making a purchase — all within the same app.

Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest are already building features to make the shopping experience more intuitive, and we’ll likely see new features such as augmented reality (AR) try-ons, advanced product recommendations, and even virtual stores.

Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality Integration

Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are gaining traction in social media, and by 2025, they’ll be even more embedded in the user experience. We’re already seeing AR features on platforms like Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook, where users can try on makeup, clothes, and accessories virtually.

In 2025, expect AR and VR to become even more immersive, with platforms offering new features like virtual showrooms, 3D product demos, and immersive experiences that make online shopping feel as tangible as in-store experiences. These technologies will help brands connect digital and physical experiences, boosting both engagement and conversions.

Influencer Marketing Evolves

Influencer marketing is far from fading; in fact, it’s evolving. As we move into 2025, micro and nano-influencers (those with smaller but more engaged followings) will become even more important. This shift is driven by the growing desire for authenticity in brand partnerships.

Brands are increasingly looking to collaborate with influencers who have niche audiences that match their target market. Expect influencer partnerships to be more collaborative, with creators having a say in the content they produce, making the messaging feel more authentic and relatable.

Brands will also start using AI tools to track and optimize the ROI of influencer campaigns, helping them make the most of these collaborations.

Social Media Platforms Embrace Privacy and Data Security

As data privacy concerns increase, social media platforms in 2025 will prioritize transparency and give users more control over their personal information. This will include more granular privacy settings and clearer opt-in consent forms for data usage.

Brands will need to adapt to these changes by ensuring they handle user data responsibly and comply with evolving privacy regulations. To earn back user trust, social media platforms are gearing up to introduce stronger security features, ensuring better protection from data breaches and creating a safer online space for their communities.

Sustainability and Social Responsibility in Social Media

In 2025, sustainability and social responsibility will be central themes for brands on social media. With increasing awareness of environmental and social issues, users are demanding that brands take a stand on important causes.

Brands will be expected to showcase their sustainability efforts and involvement in social justice causes through transparent and impactful messaging. Social media will keep playing a crucial role in helping brands express their values and engage with communities that resonate with those ideals.

In the future, expect to see a surge in campaigns centered around sustainability, charitable causes, and inclusivity.

Metaverse Integration

Though the Metaverse has been steadily growing in popularity, 2025 could mark its emergence as a dominant force in the social media world. As virtual worlds and immersive experiences evolve, platforms like Facebook (now Meta) are pushing forward with the integration of the Metaverse into their platforms.

For marketers, this could mean new virtual spaces for branding, advertising, and community building. Think of virtual stores, events, and live experiences that users can access with VR headsets or other immersive technologies. The Metaverse offers an entirely new world for brands to explore and engage with users in a novel way.

Ephemeral Content Remains Key

Ephemeral content — posts, stories, or videos that disappear after a set time — will continue to thrive in 2025. Platforms like Instagram Stories, Snapchat, and even LinkedIn Stories have proven that temporary content creates urgency and fosters more engagement.

In the near future, brands will likely lean more into ephemeral content to create a feeling of exclusivity and urgency, encouraging audiences to engage before it disappears. From behind-the-scenes glimpses to limited-time offers, ephemeral content will remain a valuable tool for driving engagement and creating authentic, real-time interactions.

AI and Automation in Social Media Management

As the demands of social media management grow, businesses will increasingly rely on AI and automation to streamline processes like content scheduling, customer service, and social listening. AI-powered tools will help marketers create more targeted content, analyze audience sentiment, and automate responses to customer inquiries.

In 2025, social media automation will be further refined, with more tools offering smart insights and personalized recommendations to optimize campaigns. While automation will increase efficiency, it’s crucial for brands to balance it with a human touch to maintain authenticity.

Final Thoughts

Social media in 2025 will be all about deeper engagement, more immersive experiences, and enhanced personalization. With AI transforming content creation, AR/VR pushing new boundaries, and social commerce booming, brands that keep up with these emerging trends will be the ones that truly stand out and build stronger connections with their audiences.

By embracing these trends, marketers can create more engaging, impactful social media strategies that resonate with the audiences of tomorrow. Now is the time to get ready, so your brand stays ahead and succeeds in the constantly shifting social media world.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Why the word rebrand needs a rebrand,venturethree is the branding agency that hates rebrands.,https://www.creativebloq.com/design/branding/why-the-word-rebrand-needs-a-rebrand,2025-03-24,"A creative agency that hates rebrands. Provocative? Well, maybe not as much as you think. The clue is in the word itself: the “rebrand.” It implies an air of self-indulgence. Self care for your business. Like a new lick of paint or a new CMO making moves. A spring clean for your brand. With the best rebrands, the intention behind it is immediately clear – but too often, the rebrand becomes a distraction, and too many people end up missing why behind the what.

We live in a fast-moving world where the focus is often on the wrong things. The logo. The colours. The new typography. Is it woke? Does it honour a legacy? Is it ugly? Too modern – or not modern enough? Have we seen it all before? Should it never have been changed in the first place? Just look at the recent response to the Jaguar rebrand. All too often, a rebrand is boiled down to the lowest common denominator in both the design and mainstream press and across social media platforms. Clickbait. Knee-jerk reactions. Focusing on the colour, or a new font.

The recent Jaguar rebrand raised eyebrows (Image credit: Jaguar)

Now, I’m not saying these aren’t important. They are. A unique creative expression is business critical these days. But these elements of a rebrand are just the visible outcome and are almost always – when done well – in service of a much bigger picture. A new business vision. A full repositioning in the market against new competition, or in your existing and potential customers’ eyes. Opening to new markets, often positioned alongside a new product, service or offer to back up the business reset.

At venturethree, we challenge rebrand briefs by addressing core values, vision and the ‘why’ behind a brand’s existence to ensure branding work aligns with a brand’s reset, recalibration or repositioning, and has the potential to act as a catalyst for needed organisational change.

Sometimes that bigger picture reveals itself immediately, sometimes more slowly. But if and when it is there, the word “rebrand” simply does not do it justice. The best work happens when the full suite of brand tools is applied both internally and externally, influencing absolutely every aspect of a business: its customer experience, capabilities, culture and communications. Its vision and North Star. Metrics that the external commentator will never be privy to, but hopefully one day will simply feel.

To get there, brand leaders need to ask not “does my company need a rebrand?” and instead “what is our brand trying to achieve?” Is it fit for purpose in terms of the direction we want to travel? And how can capital-B “Brand” achieve this, rather than just brand expression?

Take Sports Direct for example. For 30 years, they had been known as the go-to for low-cost sports gear but with a new brand strategy and identity, we helped them transform from a high street value player to an empowerment champion. Built on the promise of “equal through sport,” the new identity — an equal sign — puts equality and inclusivity at the heart of the brand. By utilising the power of sport to champion everyone, a deeper purpose for the brand was unlocked, focusing on accessibility and an ongoing promise to make people feel confident and empowered, whatever their goal, budget or ability.

There’s also Meta, which boldly moved away from the Facebook brand, not only consolidating its apps and technologies under one unified company brand but also signalling its intent to lead the growing metaverse. This is when a rebrand is much more than a rebrand. When the actions are louder than the word. That catch-all word that often falls short. For now, maybe the rebrand needs a rebrand.",0.9978,0.035,0.815,0.15

Facebook and Instagram owner Meta is considering a paid subscription in the UK which would remove adverts from its platforms. Under the plans, people using the social media sites could be asked to pay for an ad-free experience if they do not want their data to be tracked. It comes as the company agreed to stop targeting ads at a British woman last week following a protracted legal battle. Meta already provides ad-free subscriptions for Facebook and Instagram users in the EU, starting from €5.99 (£5) a month. A spokesperson for the firm said the company was ""exploring the option"" of offering a similar service in the UK.

They said the firm was ""engaging constructively"" with the UK data watchdog about the subscription service, following a consultation in 2024. The Information Commissioner's Office previously said it expected Meta to consider data protection concerns before it launched an ad-free subscription. Meta says personalised advertising allows its platforms to be free at the point of access. Guidance issued by the regulator in January states that users must be presented with a genuine free choice. Social media platforms such as Meta heavily rely on ad revenues, and the company says personalised advertising allows its platforms to be free. Advertising accounted for more than 96% of its revenue in its latest quarterly financial results. Other social platforms including Snapchat, TikTok and X (formerly Twitter) have also looked to ad-free options as a way to raise more money through subscriptions.

Consent or pay

A number of online services, such as news publishers, are asking users to either pay up or consent to being tracked while using the platform for free. The Guardian became the latest UK publisher to start doing this in March, following in the footsteps of the Daily Mirror, the Independent and others. The advertising model, known as ""consent or pay"", has become increasingly popular. Publishers say they have no choice due to growing pressures on their finances, while campaigners say it is unfair to users to ask them to pay up in exchange for not being targeted with ads. And ""consent or pay"" models may fall foul of data protection law in the UK if a user's consent has not been ""freely given"", according to the ICO. ""If organisations choose to adopt a 'consent or pay' model, they must demonstrate the model is compliant with UK data protection law,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""This means that, among other data protection standards, organisations must demonstrate that people can freely give their consent to processing of their personal information for personalised advertising.""

Meta’s Facebook and Instagram platforms, TikTok, and YouTube are an integral part of marketers’ strategies this year (again), but how exactly will they know whether they’re successful on those platforms? Engagement, impressions and sales will be the top performance metrics marketers will be looking at in 2025.

That’s according to a Digiday+ Research survey of 150 marketer professionals conducted in Q1 of this year.

Digiday’s survey found that the top three social platforms among marketers this year are Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok (yes, I know that’s four — stay with me). Instagram is the No. 1 social platform for marketers as of Q1 2025, with 93% of marketer pros saying their companies currently use the platform, followed by its Meta sibling Facebook, at 84%. YouTube and TikTok tied for third place, with 65% of marketers saying their companies currently use each platform.

It’s a slightly different picture from what social media marketing looked like six months ago, but the key word here is slightly. Instagram and Facebook were still the top two social platforms in Digiday’s Q3 2024 survey, with 97% of marketer pros saying their companies were using Instagram and 89% saying they were using Facebook. TikTok came in a definitive third place, though, with 86% of marketers saying their companies were using the platform — a significant difference from the 65% who said the same in Q1 of this year. YouTube came in fourth, with 73% of marketers using that platform as of Q3 2024 — another notable difference from the 65% who said they’re currently using the platform in Q1 2025.

Once we move out of the top three (slash four) social platforms, the percentage of marketers who use the different social platforms falls off significantly. Pinterest came in fourth place among the platforms included in Digiday’s Q1 survey, with less than a third of marketers (29%) saying their companies use Pinterest, and X came in fifth place, with just 16% of marketers using the platform. Reddit tied with X for fifth.

When it comes to how marketers are measuring success on the social platforms they use, engagement turned out to be the most important metric. More than a quarter of marketer pros (26%) said engagement is their main measurement of success on Facebook, more than a third (37%) said the same of Instagram and nearly half (42%) said engagement is their main measurement of success on TikTok, making it the top metric on these platforms.

Of the top social platforms in Digiday’s survey, only YouTube had a metric other than engagement come out as the top measurement of success: 34% of marketers said impressions are their main measurement of success on YouTube. A significant percentage of marketers still consider engagement to be important on YouTube, though. Thirty-one percent of marketer pros said engagement is their main measurement of success on the platform.

Digiday’s survey found that commerce or sales is also important for marketers on the top social platforms — it showed up as one of the top three metrics on all of the top three (OK, technically four) platforms. Twenty-nine percent of marketers said commerce or sales is their main measurement of success on Instagram, 25% said the same of Facebook, 15% of marketers said the same of YouTube and 18% said the same of TikTok.

Digiday’s survey found that cost is a major hurdle for marketers when it comes to advertising on social platforms — which, in today’s environment, shouldn’t necessarily come as a surprise. Cost of media is the top challenge marketers chose on both Meta platforms (which maybe says something about the state of advertising with the social giant): 28% of marketer pros said cost of media is the biggest challenge they face on Instagram and 23% said the same of Facebook.

Lack of budget is the top challenge on YouTube — so, along the same lines as Instagram and Facebook. Twenty-three percent of marketers said lack of budget is the biggest challenge they face on YouTube. This challenge also came up for marketers on TikTok — 17% said lack of budget is their biggest challenge on the platform — but it didn’t come out as the top challenge there. Lack of resources and content demands did, with 18% of marketer pros choosing it as their top challenge on TikTok.

It’s also worth noting that 19% of marketers said lack of budget is the biggest challenge they face on Instagram, and that cost of media is the No. 2 challenge among marketers on YouTube, with 22% of respondents to Digiday’s survey saying it’s their biggest challenge on the platform.",0.9989,0.019,0.82,0.161

Google is to acquire cloud cyber-security startup Wiz for an eye-watering $32 billion after wooing the company’s founders for a protracted period of time. Google tried to buy Wiz last summer for $23 billion but was turned down with the startup declaring it would prefer to pursue an IPO.

Now - though the deal is subject to regulatory review - Google’s persistence looks to have paid off. In a blog post Wiz co-founder and CEO Assaf Rappaport said: “Wiz has achieved so much in a relatively short period, but cybersecurity moves at warp speed and so must we. The time is now. We expect this change to enable us to execute and innovate even faster. Becoming part of Google Cloud is effectively strapping a rocket to our backs: it will accelerate our rate of innovation faster than what we could achieve as a standalone company.”

According to TechCrunch, Google will position Wiz as a multicloud solution, ensuring that its security services are compatible across different platforms, and not limited to Google Cloud. Wiz also brings a large list of customers who chose Wiz because of its ability to support multiple cloud platforms and who may not use Google Cloud at all. And, as TechCrunch also points out, Google needs to embrace the multicloud model simply in order to stand any chance of competing with MS Azure and AWS, which both have a much bigger share of the global cloud market.

A Harris survey and report on behalf of AI platform Dataiku throws up some interesting stats and food for thought for product managers and others working with artificial intelligence. The report, Global AI Confessions Report: CEO Edition, surveyed over 500 CEOs worldwide and finds that:

Said Florian Douetteau, CEO of Dataiku: “For CEOs today, every AI decision feels like a high-stakes gamble that can drive competitive dominance or lead to costly consequences. The only way to turn AI into an enduring advantage is to assert greater control and governance — future-proofing not just the companies these CEOs run, but their own roles as leaders in an increasingly AI-powered economy.”

Some weeks after announcing it would replace independent fact checkers with X (formerly Twitter)-style crowdsourced fact checks, Meta has launched Community Notes for Facebook, Instagram and Threads users in the US. The company says it will concentrate on getting Community Notes right in the US before it is rolled out elsewhere in the world.

Historically Meta has referred content that might be false or misleading to independent organisations to assess their reliability. This historic independent fact checking process has been criticised for things, including a lack of transparency, lack of recourse and inconsistent enforcement. A blog post from Meta at the start of the year stated: ”Over time we ended up with too much content being fact checked that people would understand to be legitimate political speech and debate. Our system then attached real consequences in the form of intrusive labels and reduced distribution. A program intended to inform too often became a tool to censor.”

Equally the Community Notes initiative that will replace independent fact checking is being criticised for the same reasons that the X initiative has been decried, including: the risk that fact checking can be gamified and misinformation amplified, lack of necessary expertise to check complex claims, limited global and cultural perspectives and a lack of transparency and accountability.

And those people follow through on their searches: 37.3% of U.S. Instagram users will make at least one purchase through the platform in 2025. Make sure your products are there for them to find, and easy to buy when they do.

Shoppers spend more on Instagram than on other platforms: Instagram ranks highest among all social media platforms for people who spend $200 or more – 40.1% of Instagram shoppers reach this threshold. Perhaps that’s because 58% of Americans who earn more than $100K a year use the platform.

Instagram shopping features you need to know

Shop

An Instagram Shop is a customizable digital storefront, which allows customers to shop right from your Instagram profile. Think of it as a landing page where users can discover or browse all your products.

Tags

Shopping Tags allow you to tag products from your catalog in your organic Instagram content and ads, so your audience can tap through to learn more or buy right from their Instagram feed.

Saved Products

Formerly known as wish lists, this feature allows users to save your products for later, in case they’re not ready to buy right away. They simply tap the save icon on any product to add it to their saved products list within the Instagram app.

Checkout on Facebook or Instagram

This is Meta’s native payment solution that allows customers to complete purchases directly in Instagram, without leaving the app. It’s only available to U.S.-based shops. Shops in other supported markets link to a product detail page on the seller’s website to complete purchases.

How to get started in 6 easy steps

Step 1: Convert to a Business or Creator Account

If you don’t already have a Business (or Creator) account on Instagram, it’s time to take the plunge.

Besides qualifying you for Instagram Shopping features, Business accounts also have access to detailed analytics… and can use Hootsuite’s scheduling dashboard for posts, too.

Just tap Edit Profile, then Switch to professional account. Want more details? Here’s our step-by-step guide to switching your personal account over (and 8 reasons why you should!).

Step 2: Use Commerce Manager to set up a shop

1. Head to Commerce Manager to set up Instagram shopping. When you visit Commerce Manager for the first time, you’ll see a Get Started screen. Click Next to enter the workflow and set up your shop.

2. If you’re using a partner platform like Shopify or Magento, you can select it to create your Instagram shop directly on that platform. Otherwise, select I don’t use these platforms and click Next.

3. Choose the country where your shop is located. This will impact your available checkout methods. If your shop is based in the United States, you need to use Checkout on Facebook or Instagram, so it will bump you straight through to sales channels. For other countries, you can select Checkout on another website, or Checkout with messaging.

4. Select the Instagram business account you want to be associated with your shop. If you don’t already have a business portfolio set up on Meta (for a Facebook shop or Facebook business page), you’ll need to create one.

5. If you already have a product catalog set up on Meta , select it. Otherwise, click Create new catalog and give it a name. You’ll add products after you finish setting up your shop.

6. Select where you ship to, review your shop details, and click Finish setup to submit your shop for review by Meta.

Step 3: Upload your product catalog

You can either input every product manually into Commerce Manager, or you can integrate a pre-existing product database from a certified eCommerce platform (like Shopify or BigCommerce.)

Tip: Hootsuite has a Shopify integration, so it’s super simple to manage your catalog right from your dashboard!

Let’s walk through each catalog creation option step-by-step.

Option A: Commerce Manager

1. Log into Commerce Manager.

2. Select your catalog and click Add Products.

3. Select Manual.

5. Add a product image, name, description, website link, and price.

5. Add categorization details about the product, like its condition, brand, and tax category. If you have an SKU or unique identifier for your product, add it within the Content ID section.

6. Once you’re done, click Add Product.

Option B: Integrate an Ecommerce Database

1. Go to Commerce Manager.

2. Select your catalog and click Add Products.

3. Select Partner Platform.

4. Select your platform of choice from the list provided.

5. Follow the link to the partner platform website and follow the steps there to connect your account.

Tip: Once your catalog is set up, it’s important to maintain it. Always keep product photos updated and hide unavailable items. If you connect your catalog through a platform like Shopify this will happen automatically.

Step 6: Create Instagram shopping content

Now that you’ve created the bones of our Instagram shop, you’re ready to start creating shoppable Instagram content.

Posts, Reels, and carousels: Create your content as usual. In the final screen, where you can tag people and add a location, tap More options , then Tag products .

Create your content as usual. In the final screen, where you can tag people and add a location, tap , then . Stories: Create your story as usual. Tap the sticker icon and select the Shopping sticker.

Create your story as usual. Tap the and select the sticker. Ads: Either boost a Shoppable post that you’ve already created, or build an ad with shopping tags from scratch in Meta Ads Manager. Our guide to Instagram advertising dives into more specifics on how to use Ads Manager tools.

You can also create (and schedule) shoppable Instagram posts within Hootsuite to manage this content alongside all your other social posts.

From your Hootsuite dashboard, click Create , then Post , then select the relevant Instagram business profile in the Publish to field.

, then , then select the relevant Instagram business profile in the field. Create your post as usual. In the right preview screen, click Tag products, click the image, and select the relevant product from your catalog.

6 tips for optimizing your profile for Instagram shopping

1. Curate your products and collections

Rather than making your shop a free-for-all, you can curate your products into categories and collections based on trends, seasonality, or any other theme that makes sense for your business.

Head to Commerce Manager, and under Catalog, click Sets, then Create set. You can choose to manually add products to a set or use filters to automatically group products by type, price, or other attributes. These sets appear as collections in your shop.

You can also customize the layout of your Instagram shop to highlight a specific collection, product, or offer.

In Commerce Manager, click Shops, then Edit Shop. Above the image of your shop, click Preview to open the interactive preview and editing options.

Meta can automatically personalize your shop for each person if you toggle on the Optimize layout switch. If you’d prefer to set things up manually and adjust them to work with specific campaigns or seasonal promotions, you can do that using the options on the left of the screen.

For example, 32 Lakes Coffee Roasters has their shop set up using automatic optimization for each user. Since I’ve purchased locally made clothing through brands I follow on Instagram before, the shop automatically shows me the brand’s T-shirts and sweatshirts before any of the actual coffee. Scrolling down, I get to the collection of Customer favorites – not surprisingly, coffee features more prominently here.

On the other hand, environmental home essentials brand etee places their collections up top and has the auto-generated Suggested for you category further down the page.

2. Focus on high-quality product images and descriptions

There’s not a lot of space for copy on your Instagram shop homepage, so product images really need to do the heavy lifting.

“Take the time to style and professionally photograph each individual item you’re selling,” says Rengie Wisper, marketing manager at Palmako. “Zoom in and get detailed shots that highlight the textures, colors and unique features of your products. You really want them to pop on that small screen! After improving my own product images, I saw a noticeable boost in engagement and sales.”

But save the static product images for your shop homepage and catalog. In your shoppable content (Instagram Stories, Reels, posts, and carousels), show your products in context rather than in isolation.

“Show someone wearing your bestselling earrings in a lifestyle setting – perhaps a casual coffee date or night out.” says Aaron Whittaker, VP of demand generation & marketing at Thrive Digital Marketing Agency. “Tag the earrings, include a short eye-catching caption (such as “A little sparkle goes a long way – tap to shop your next favorite pair!”), and use relevant hashtags.”

Or, as in this shoppable Instagram ad from LF Jewellery, you could do both. A quick video of someone wearing the necklaces is combined in a carousel with clean product imagery featuring multiple tagged products.

Source: LF Jewellery

Don’t neglect the product descriptions. The product image catches potential buyers’ attention, but the product information copy is critical to build trust and drive conversions.

3. Use Reels to entertain and sell

While nearly half (44%) of Instagram users say they use the app to look at product reviews and recommendations, 86% say they use Instagram because it’s entertaining. In order to build relationships that drive Instagram sales, you need to focus on providing solid entertainment value for your audience.

Entertainment doesn’t have to be comedic – you need to find the tone that best fits with your brand voice. Then look for ways to feature your products in content that provides solid value to your audience, and use product tags to drive taps through to your shop.

One example is to provide insights into how your products are made, as Earth Angel does in this behind-the-scenes Reel with a shopping tag:

4. Use UGC to create brand trust

User-generated content (UGC) refers to any posts or Stories from other Instagram users that feature your brand.

Not only do these posts provide new, real images of your photos in action, but they also boost your credibility. That’s because posts from real users are considered more authentic, and that authenticity translates to higher trust.

“For a fashion client, testing user-generated content versus professional photography revealed a 20% higher conversion with authentic, user-centered posts,” said Kiel Tredrea, president & CMO of RED 27 Creative.

Fortunately, Instagram shops have a built-in way to connect product tags and UGC. When someone tags your brand account in a post, you can tap into the Shopping tools on the Instagram app to request permission to add product tags. The original creator will get a notification and can choose to accept or decline your request.

If they accept, the post can appear on your product page in a section called From the Community.

You can also encourage your followers to tag your products directly in their content, as this functionality is available to anyone unless you limit permissions on product tags. For instance, in this post on my own account, I can tag the jacket that I bought from Simons.

However, I can’t tag my sunglasses because Ray-Ban has turned off the ability for users to tag their products. That said, I could still tag the Ray-Ban account and they could request to tag the product if they choose.

We’ve got a whole post on how to encourage UGC to get you started.

5. Try shoppable collaborative posts

If you don’t want all Instagram users to be able to tag your products, you can choose to limit product tagging to your brand partners (aka influencers). This is a great way to link posts from your creator partners directly to your Instagram shop.

You can also create collaborative Instagram shopping posts. In this case, the post appears on both your brand account and the account of the person you choose to collaborate with. The product tags appear in both versions of the post and therefore reach double the audience.

6. Create anticipation with a launch preview

If you connect your Instagram shop with a shopping partner like Shopify or a merchandise provider like Spring, you can create a product launch event with previews of the items you’ll launch at a specific time. This builds anticipation and excitement about your launch and can create an early influx of orders when the items go live.

The artist behind @loxythemaker used an Instagram launch set up through Shopify to tease the launch time of her new collection of earrings. When they went live, several designs sold out within 24 hours.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Bipartisan Effort to Sunset the ‘26 Words That Created the Internet’ Is on the Way,The law has drawn ire from both the left and the right.,https://gizmodo.com/bipartisan-effort-to-sunset-the-26-words-that-created-the-internet-is-on-the-way-2000579297,2025-03-21,"Section 230, the linchpin law that has dictated how online platforms have been regulated for decades, appears destined to come to an end. According to The Information, Democratic Senator Dick Durbin and Republican Lindsey Graham are planning to introduce a new bill that will set an expiration date for the law and encourage tech companies to offer alternatives as to what should replace it.

Per The Information, the bill could be introduced as early as Monday, March 24, and is expected to have bipartisan support from Republicans Josh Hawley and Marsha Blackburn and Democrats Sheldon Whitehouse and Amy Klobuchar, who are reportedly ready to co-sponsor the bill. It’s also a modified version of a proposal made last year in the House by Republican Cathy Rodgers and Democrat Frank Pallone, Jr., so there is some juice for this thing throughout Congress. The proposal would effectively sunset Section 230, setting January 1, 2027, as a drop-dead date for the law that so many tech companies have leaned on to duck legal challenges.

The gambit that Durbin and Graham appear to be attempting is to force tech companies to the table and talk about Section 230 alternatives. By setting a deadline, the message is basically, “Come help us write the replacement law or lose this protection in its entirety.” The latter should be basically an intolerable outcome for tech firms, as it would leave them extremely exposed to legal challenges.

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as it stands, essentially grants companies legal immunity from being held legally liable for the content posted on their platforms by users. It is often referred to as the “26 words that created the internet” because it created a framework for user-generated content. But its legal protection of companies has come under fire from both major political parties for very different reasons.

Democrats have come after Section 230 for allowing Big Tech companies to be derelict in their duties to remove harmful and hateful content, falling short of the “Good Samaritan” standard of good faith moderation. Scrutiny from the left turned up during the COVID pandemic when misinformation was rampant on platforms like Facebook and some Democrats wanted the company to do more to address the issue. Republicans, meanwhile want Section 230 repealed because they believe tech companies have been overzealous in removing content and think their viewpoints have been “censored.” It’s here where you can see the cracks start forming in this bipartisan effort.

There is probably room to reevaluate the protections granted under Section 230. After all, it was written in 1996 when the internet was in its nascent stages and the monopolistic forces of companies like Meta or YouTube would have been hard to imagine. For instance, it might be worth asking, even if platforms shouldn’t be held liable for what random users post, should they be held liable for algorithmically promoting that content if it is illegal or harmful?

But that brings us back to the fundamental divide between the two parties invested in upending Section 230. They can agree that they want to roll it back. But their goals in doing that are diametrically opposed. If the parties agree to repeal Section 230 but can’t come to an agreement on what should come next, you end up with the worst of all worlds. Frankly, with this Congress and President, that seems about par for the course.",0.9813,0.049,0.839,0.111
"META Platforms, Facebook.",Meta Tests AI-Generated Comments To Enhance User Interaction On Instagram,"Meta is exploring new ways to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into social media interactions, particularly by allowing users to generate AI-powered comments. While AI-generated responses are not new—Facebook already suggests comments on profile picture…",https://www.ubergizmo.com/2025/03/meta-ai-instagram/,2025-03-21,"Meta is exploring new ways to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into social media interactions, particularly by allowing users to generate AI-powered comments. While AI-generated responses are not new—Facebook already suggests comments on profile pictures and other images—Meta is now looking to expand this feature to Instagram.

The new functionality, discovered by social media tester Jonah Manzano, aims to improve engagement in Instagram’s comment sections by assisting users in writing relevant and interactive responses. According to Manzano, Instagram is testing a feature labeled “Write with Meta AI” within the comment section of posts, allowing users to receive AI-generated comment suggestions.

Users who have access to this new tool will notice a small pencil icon within the text bar under an Instagram post. Clicking on it activates Meta AI, which then analyzes the image and generates up to three suggested comments based on its content. If users are not satisfied with the initial suggestions, they can request alternative options.

Short video how it works pic.twitter.com/WdVOxcumZa — Jonah Manzano (@jonah_manzano) March 15, 2025

A Meta spokesperson confirmed the testing phase, emphasizing that AI is being integrated into multiple aspects of the platform beyond just direct messaging. According to the company, AI-powered features are also being tested in comments, feeds, groups, and searches to enhance the overall user experience.

“We regularly test new ways for users to engage with Meta AI across our apps. Beyond DMs, you’ll find Meta AI assisting in comments, feeds, groups, and search to make your experiences more engaging and useful.”

This move aligns with Meta’s broader strategy to integrate AI across its social media ecosystem, ensuring users have a more interactive and seamless experience. By leveraging AI to suggest meaningful responses, the company hopes to foster better engagement and encourage more dynamic conversations in comment sections.

The feature could also benefit brands, influencers, and casual users by streamlining responses, saving time, and reducing the effort needed to craft engaging comments. However, it remains to be seen how the AI-generated responses will be received by users and whether they will enhance or diminish the authenticity of social media interactions.

Meta has not yet announced when or if this feature will be widely available, but the testing phase suggests a growing focus on AI-powered enhancements across its platforms.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",11 WTF Moments from the Facebook Memoir Mark Zuckerberg Doesn’t Want You to Read,'Careless People': 11 wild moments from the tell-all Facebook memoir that Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg don't want you to read.,http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/careless-people-facebook-memoir-1235299645/,2025-03-21,"Anyone miserable in their jobs will take some solace from Careless People, a blistering new memoir by Sarah Wynn-Williams, former global public policy director at Facebook (since rebranded as Meta). This tale of her years at the company, from her idealistic pitch for an international role in 2011 to her firing in 2017, charts a descent into the swamp of Silicon Valley’s narcissistic greed and frigid amorality, offering personal indictments of several executives to whom she answered, including Joel Kaplan, Sheryl Sandberg, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

In the book, Wynn-Williams details how Facebook’s managerial disputes and failures in this period, when it was rapidly expanding around the globe, had dire and fatal effects. Able to describe even her near-death by shark attack in her New Zealand childhood with frighteningly sober clarity, the former diplomat covers political scandals and workplace nightmares with zero hyperbole — only regret for continuing to believe in Facebook’s potential as signs of catastrophe grew impossible to ignore.

Meta has sought to limit the impact of Careless People, winning an emergency ruling from a U.S. arbitrator to prevent Wynn-Williams from distributing or promoting the book, which was kept a closely guarded secret until shortly before its release this month. In a statement shared with Rolling Stone, the company dismissed it as “a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives,” claiming that Wynn-Williams was “fired for poor performance and toxic behavior,” and that “an investigation at the time determined she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment.” Former Meta employees have also disputed details of the book. A representative for Sandberg, who is no longer with the company, declined to comment about how she is depicted in Careless People. Macmillan Publishers and its imprint Flatiron Books are standing behind the tell-all, which is now the New York Times number one bestseller. Editor’s picks

Here are 11 of the wildest moments from Wynn-William’s journey to the heart of Big Tech.

An Aborted Organ Drive

Early in her tenure at Facebook, Wynn-Williams writes, she sought to convince leadership to forge connections with foreign governments as it looked to grow user bases in those countries. At one point, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg decided on a global organ donation initiative, despite the overwhelming cultural, legal, and religious complexities it presented — and the fact that Facebook was hardly equipped to serve as an organ or patient registry. Wynn-Williams recalls how frustrated Sandberg became when she heard that the program would merely encourage people to sign up with local donation sites, in part because of concerns about the company enabling organ trafficking. Sandberg, according to the book, posed a bizarre rhetorical question: “Do you mean to tell me that if my four-year-old was dying and the only thing that would save her was a new kidney, that I couldn’t fly to Mexico and get one and put it in my handbag?” Wynn-Williams writes that she was forced to carefully explain, to Sandberg’s apparent displeasure, that this is indeed illegal. The initiative was radically scaled down, though Sandberg ensured that “registered as an organ donor” could appear on user pages as a “life event,” like a marriage or moving to a new city.

Hillary Clinton in a Colombian Salsa Club

One surreal scene unfolded on a trip Wynn-Williams took to Cartagena, Colombia, in 2012, with Facebook’s head of global growth, Javier Olivan. Wynn-Williams writes that she was given the unusual mission of convincing this executive to remain at the company even after he and other early employees struck it rich on an imminent IPO, and by her own admission, she didn’t really know how she might make the case for staying. But the visit for a summit among heads of state went well enough, and, after midnight one evening, she found herself partying with her coworker and some of his friends in the area, who eventually migrated from the tourist center of the city into “gritty neighborhoods” and found a “back-alley salsa club.” It was there that Olivan declared he had spotted Hillary Clinton. Wynn-Williams chalked it up to “the drinks and the excitement of the summit,” arguing, “there is no chance that the U.S. secretary of state is here.” Lo and behold, Clinton was partying, too: “Beer in hand, next to the band, dancing with a small group of her staff, security detail conspicuous with their earpieces in the steamy club.” The cabinet official was “completely caught up in the music, right in the front, clapping and swinging her hips.” Some after-hours diplomacy, it seems.

Bruising Board Games

As Facebook’s influence spread and Wynn-Williams’ role became more significant, she spent more time with Mark Zuckerberg, and writes that their office relationship could be quite awkward. At one point, Zuckerberg told her he had no interest in meeting the prime minister of New Zealand, not realizing the prime minister was standing with them. The social interactions weren’t always much better. During a tour of Asia, she writes, Zuckerberg suggested playing the strategy board game Settlers of Catan — and while everyone got into the nerdy spirit of it, Wynn-Williams began to suspect that her colleagues deliberately never went after their boss. “You’re letting him win,” she told them, but they denied it, while Zuckerberg, she writes, seemed totally oblivious. Years later, she again played board games with Zuckerberg on his private jet, and didn’t hold back, beating him twice in a row. Both times, she says, he accused her of cheating. “You had multiple ways to win,” she informed him the second time, laying out the better moves he could have made toward the end of the round. The dispute turned into a discussion of how Zuckerberg, in Wynn-Williams’ eyes, had mismanaged Facebook. “You’re so used to being the winner who takes all,” she told him.

The Casual Suggestion of Election Interference Abroad

Wynn-Williams was often shocked by the incurious nature of others at Facebook, she writes, especially what she saw as their seeming indifference to basic laws and norms abroad. After Joel Kaplan, a former White House chief of staff under George W. Bush, became her boss on the policy team, he moved aggressively to turn profits through political and electoral advertising in other countries — while, she claims, still having to be informed where certain Latin American nations were and that Taiwan is an island. Soon, Facebook was facing regulatory problems in other countries because of its election advertising. Apparently undeterred, Kaplan told Wynn-Williams that Facebook should establish political action committees around the world, she claims, only to learn from her that this is illegal. “Nobody wants foreigners bankrolling their elections,” she explained. In his surprise, she writes, he changed tack, saying, “We need to get moving on channeling money to our key allies offshore, you know, our most influential politicians in other countries.” Wynn-Williams said that this would be viewed as bribery and corruption, except perhaps by dictators, who would gladly take the money. “For a minute I worry that he’s seriously considering it,” she writes. The chapter ends there, and there’s no indication Facebook spread money around this way.

Sandberg’s Bedroom Invites

Careless People paints former Facebook chief of operations Sheryl Sandberg (who left in 2022) as prone to bursts of anger and tone-deaf self-promotion, often at odds with the feminist principles she laid out in her hit corporate advice book Lean In, and unmoved by the plight of other women working in male-dominated Silicon Valley. More strangely, however, Wynn-Williams claims that Sandberg had a habit of crossing boundaries with her female subordinates. Not only did they have to assist on matters like book tours and public appearances that fell outside their job responsibilities, she writes, but they were sometimes instructed to join Sandberg in her bed on her private jet. On a flight back to the U.S. following the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Wynn-Williams planned to spend the hours in the air working on a debrief as required by Sandberg, but the executive continued to insist — while wearing her pajamas — that she “come to bed” in the jet’s sole bedroom. Thinking that “it wouldn’t be right for a male COO to ask for this and it’s not right for a female one to,” Wynn-Williams kept refusing. She writes that Sandberg, irritated by this, said one more thing to her when the plane eventually landed in California: “You should have got into the bed.” On a later trip, Wynn-Williams claims she saw another of Sandberg’s female employees go into the bedroom with her at her request.

‘Heartwarming’ Arrest of Employee

In 2016, Diego Dzodan, a Facebook vice president in Brazil, was arrested because WhatsApp, which the company owns, wouldn’t hand over messages related to a drug trafficking case. Wynn-Williams was horrified by the situation, but Zuckerberg — charmed by Dzodan’s allegiance to him in the face of possible prosecution by a nation with strict internet laws — wanted to celebrate the moment with a Facebook post, Wynn-Williams says. He drafted several versions, she writes, originally calling it a “heartwarming story” and claiming that Dzodan was acting in order to “protect our community,” while neglecting to mention that Facebook was shielding the privacy of an accused drug trafficking organization that had threatened to assassinate the judge in the case. She says that employees also warned a stubborn Zuckerberg that such a message would sabotage their legal defense of Dzodan, which was to tell the court that WhatsApp was a distinct company, and that a Facebook vice president can’t be held responsible for its decisions. Throughout internal discussions, Wynn-Williams observes, Zuckerberg “doesn’t seem to be worried about Diego in the slightest.” Ultimately, Dzodan was released within a day, and Zuckerberg never shared his “heartwarming” update on the vice president’s brief detainment.

Patterns of Alleged Sexual Harassment and Possible Retaliation

According to Wynn-Williams, Kaplan, her former boss, asked about her breastfeeding and the effects of the amniotic fluid embolism that nearly killed her after she gave birth to her second child, and deliberately drew attention to his habit of joining their virtual meetings from his bed. She alleges that he also commented on her looks and ground against her while dancing at a corporate event. Wynn-Williams further claims that he required her to do work during her second maternity leave and subjected her to a performance review the day she formally returned to the office, complaining she wasn’t “responsive enough” during her time recovering from the difficult birth and a coma due to extensive blood loss. During an unrelated internal investigation, Wynn-Williams put some of her complaints about Kaplan on the record with company lawyers, she writes, though when the possibility of a probe into Kaplan was floated, she agreed to drop it if he would stop making her uncomfortable. But he didn’t, she claims, and Kaplan effectively demoted her after this. She writes that a subsequent investigation into his behavior cleared him of any wrongdoing — then, at Wynn-Williams’ next performance review, she was summarily fired and escorted out of the office by a security guard, she writes. Responding to a request for comment from Rolling Stone on this matter, Meta claimed that the investigation into Wynn-Williams’ harassment claims was thorough and took longer than the average case, involving a review of all the documents she provided and 17 witness interviews.

Trouble in China

Throughout Wynn-Williams’ tenure at Facebook, Zuckerberg was intent on expanding into China, where the platform was blocked. Their efforts, she writes, led to all kinds of gaffes, subterfuge, and queasy compromises. In 2015, Zuckerberg had the opportunity to shake hands with Chinese president Xi Jinping but was excluded from a closed-door meeting between Xi and other American tech CEOs. He posted a picture of himself and the back of Xi’s head anyway, making it appear that he was part of that meeting — and infuriating the Chinese government. (At a state dinner in the White House two days later, she writes, Xi declined Zuckerberg’s request to do him the honor of naming the child his wife was then carrying.) Later, Wynn-Williams was appalled at internal documents indicating the ways Facebook was evidently willing to comply with China’s censorship demands and requests for user data in exchange for being able to operate within the country someday: one memo cautioned that “Facebook employees will be responsible for user data responses that could lead to death, torture and incarceration.” In an incredibly clumsy move to penetrate the Chinese market, Facebook secretly released apps in the country through shell corporations without authorization, but supposedly with the tacit approval of China’s internet regulator. They were shut down after a New York Times story about the scheme.

Targeting Emotionally Vulnerable Kids

Careless People is unsparing in its account of how Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign gamed Facebook’s systems with misinformation and inflammatory content in the run-up to an upset election victory (and how Zuckerberg and Sandberg, in Wynn-Williams’ view, were impressed rather than alarmed by this). But the next year, Wynn-Williams writes, she discovered that the company was also courting advertisers with the option of targeting “thirteen-to-seventeen-year-olds across its platforms, including Instagram, during moments of psychological vulnerability when they feel ‘worthless,’ ‘insecure,’ ‘stressed,’ ‘defeated,’ ‘anxious,’ ‘stupid, ‘useless,’ and ‘like a failure,’” per a leaked document from a presentation to Australian brands. When the communications team considered a statement to the effect that Facebook wanted to “remedy” such practices, one member noted that they really weren’t doing anything to prevent such exploitation: users could be targeted based on emotional states, as well as racial and ethnic background. Facebook went as far as tracking when teen girls deleted selfies so that a company could “serve a beauty ad to them” right after, Wynn-Williams writes.

Employee Ignored While Having Medical Crisis

Toward the end of her time at Facebook, Wynn-Williams felt that the basic humanity of the office environment had evaporated. One day, she recounts, she heard a “commotion” and ran over to see “a woman convulsing on the floor,” foaming at the mouth and bleeding from her face as if she had hit her desk while falling. But nobody at the desks nearby helped her, instead remaining focused on their screens, she claims. She and two other people called 911, though they knew none of the information that would be useful to the dispatcher or EMTs. Wynn-Williams writes that she asked a woman “studiously concentrating on her computer” if she was the stricken woman’s manager, and she confirmed that she was, adding, “But I’m very busy.” All she said beyond that, Wynn-Williams claims, was that the ill woman was “a contractor,” that “her contract’s coming to an end soon,” and that Wynn-Williams could contact human resources for any additional information. This exchange occurred, she writes, as the woman continued to convulse.

The Myanmar Genocide

In 2013, Wynn-Williams was dispatched on a harrowing one-woman mission to Myanmar — while pregnant — to make contact with the ruling military junta and find out why they had blocked Facebook in the country. Against all odds, she was able to reach a government ministry and plead the company’s case, and soon enough, millions in the country were able to access a limited version of Facebook on their mobile phones. With that, however, came an explosion of viral hate speech and misinformation targeting the Rohingya people, a largely Muslim minority in Myanmar, which coincided with riots and the burning of mosques. Wynn-Williams claims that Facebook did not take steps to make the site compatible with the Burmese language, didn’t post their Community Standards in Burmese, failed to take down anti-Muslim slurs, blocked her attempt to hire a human rights expert in Southeast Asia to mitigate problems in the country, and, for a while, was entirely reliant on a single contractor to moderate extremist content spreading there. In 2016, following a free election that saw voters reject the junta in favor of democratic candidates, the military launched a brutal campaign against the Rohingya widely recognized as an ethnic cleansing, with thousands killed and hundreds of thousands fleeing across the border to Bangladesh. It would emerge that the junta had specifically used Facebook to inflame hate against its own Muslim population.",-0.9993,0.107,0.833,0.06

Joel Kaplan, Meta’snew global affairs officer, blasted the company’s own longstanding fact-checking program, telling Fox’s Brooke Singman it “proved to be really prone to partisan political bias” and was “essentially a censorship tool,” echoing false claims parroted by right-wing media figures and lawmakers. Unlike the fact-checking program, Meta’s community notes will rely on users who are not bound by ethical guidelines to police content for fairness and accuracy, taking a page straight out of Elon Musk’s X. Kaplan told Singman that posts with a community note applied will not be penalized and will continue to thrive on the platform, setting the stage for viral misinformation.

Starting this week, users in 41 European countries and 21 overseas territories can access Meta AI on WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. However, the European version currently offers limited functionality, focusing solely on text-based chat features.

Meta AI was first introduced in the United States in 2023, aiming to provide users with an intelligent conversational assistant capable of brainstorming ideas, planning trips, and answering questions using real-time web information. The initial rollout showcased Meta's ambition to integrate advanced AI capabilities across its suite of social media platforms.

The European launch faced significant delays due to regulatory concerns. In 2024, Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), where Meta's European headquarters are located, requested the company to suspend the use of European user data in training its AI models. This move was driven by apprehensions regarding data privacy and the potential misuse of user-generated content. Consequently, Meta halted the rollout of its multimodal Llama AI model in the European Union, citing the unpredictable nature of the European regulatory environment. The company emphasized that without local information, the AI's performance would be compromised, leading to a subpar user experience.

With the recent rollout, European users can engage with Meta AI through text-based interactions. The assistant can help brainstorm ideas, plan trips, or answer specific questions by leveraging information from the web. Notably, the AI model deployed in Europe has not been trained on first-party data from EU users, addressing some of the privacy concerns previously raised by regulators.

However, certain functionalities available in other regions remain absent in Europe:

Image Generation and Editing: Users cannot use Meta AI to generate or edit images, a feature accessible in the U.S. version.

Users cannot use Meta AI to generate or edit images, a feature accessible in the U.S. version. Multimodal Interactions: The ability to ask questions about photos or use voice inputs is currently unavailable.

These limitations underscore Meta's cautious approach in aligning with European data protection standards.

Meta has engaged extensively with European regulators over the past year to ensure compliance with regional data protection laws. Ellie Heatrick, a spokesperson for Meta, stated, ""This launch follows almost a year of intensive engagement with various European regulators, and for now, we are only offering a text-only model in the region which wasn't trained on first-party data from users in the EU.""

The company plans to work collaboratively with regulators to expand Meta AI's features in Europe, aiming to achieve parity with the U.S. version over time. This phased approach reflects Meta's strategy to balance innovation with regulatory compliance, ensuring that users in Europe can eventually access the full suite of AI capabilities without compromising on privacy and data protection.

The introduction of Meta AI in Europe positions Meta alongside other tech giants offering AI-driven assistants, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. While some users express excitement about the new features, others remain cautious due to past concerns over data privacy. The limited functionality at launch may also influence user adoption rates, as European users await the rollout of more advanced features.

In conclusion, Meta's strategic rollout of its AI assistant in Europe marks a significant step in the company's global AI ambitions. By addressing regulatory concerns and prioritizing user privacy, Meta aims to integrate advanced AI functionalities into its platforms, enhancing user experience while adhering to regional data protection standards.

The disclosure mandate will apply if an ad contains a photorealistic image, video or realistic-sounding audio that has been digitally created or altered to depict a real person as saying or doing something they did not actually say or do.

It also extends to ads that show a person who does not exist or a realistic-looking event that did not happen, alters footage of a real event or depicts an event that allegedly occurred, but is not a true image, video or audio recording of the event.

In November last year, Meta said it would extend its ban on new political ads after the U.S. election, in response to rampant misinformation during the previous presidential election.

Meta also barred political campaigns and advertisers in other regulated industries from using its new generative AI advertising products in 2023.

However, Meta scrapped its U.S. fact-checking programs earlier this year — in addition to curbs on discussions around contentious topics such as immigration and gender identity — succumbing to pressure from conservatives to implement the biggest overhaul of its approach to managing political content.

The Instagram-owner also claimed in December last year that generative AI had limited impact across its apps in 2024, failing to build a significant audience on Facebook and Instagram or use AI effectively.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Meta didn't want people to read this book. Now it's a No. 1 bestseller.,Meta tried to prevent the author from promoting her book. It backfired.,https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-employee-book-careless-people-sarah-wynn-williams-bestseller-2025-3,2025-03-20,"This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Sarah Wynn-Williams published a memoir of her time working in global policy at Meta (then called Facebook) that gave a deeply unflattering portrayal of the company and its executives.

Ahead of its March 11 release, Meta filed an emergency motion with an arbitrator. The judge ruled that Wynn-Williams had likely violated her non-disparagement agreement with the company and had to stop promoting or selling the book. (The publisher pointed out that the arbitration ruling did not affect it, and the book is currently for sale.)

Last week, I speculated that Meta's move was backfiring: it set off a new wave of headlines and drew even more attention. Come on, who wouldn't want to check out the book Mark Zuckerberg doesn't want you to read?

My theory has since gained credence. The book just debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Bestseller list for nonfiction. It also ranks fifth on Amazon's bestseller list.

Just before the ruling, Business Insider's Pranav Dixit interviewed Wynn-Williams. She doesn't appear to have conducted an interview since.

Typically, nonfiction books are announced months, more often years in advance, and review copies are sent long before the release to drum up publicity. This one abruptly burst into existence — announced less than a week before its release. But it appears the incredibly brief promotional window didn't hurt sales.

I should note here that the book is not without controversy (I suppose that's obvious). Meta has feverishly denounced its contents, dismissing it in their official statement as the work of a disgruntled employee who was fired for ""toxic behavior"" and poor performance. Meta has also said it wasn't fact-checked (an irony lost on no one, given the company's recent changes to fact-checking on its own platforms).

Andrew Bosworth, CTO of Meta, said on Threads that the book is ""full of lies. Literally stories that did not happen."" Other current and former Meta employees posted on social media that the book doesn't reflect the Meta they knew. Katie Harbath, who overlapped with Wynn-Williams and was present for some of the things that happened during the period of 2011-2017 that the book covers, wrote a blog post about how it contains inaccuracies that undermine its larger point. She wrote:

Related stories

But when the facts are wrong, the conclusions people draw are flawed, too. The company's real failures deserve scrutiny. Exaggerations, omissions, and distortions only muddy the conversation.

However, at least one former Meta employee has supported the book, writing on her public LinkedIn that it feels true to her experience.

Here's my opinion, having read the book: Ask any two coworkers what their experience at a company was a decade ago, and I promise you'll get different answers. And in a memoir written years later, yes, details and conversations could be misremembered.

But it's a forest-for-the-trees thing. The most damning moments in the book had already been reported in the news (Meta's PR dedicated an entire page on its website to point out that the book is full of ""old news""). No one on Earth, not even Mark Zuckerberg and his new philosophy of not apologizing for world events out of his control, would look at Facebook in the 2010s and not agree that mistakes were made — some of them quite serious. You already know that, we all already know that. What the book offers is a glimpse inside the rooms where those decisions were made. That's compelling.

Whether Meta's attempt to quash the book by enforcing a non-disparagement clause was another one of those mistakes? Well, I suppose soon we can argue it out in the Community Notes.",-0.9727,0.085,0.862,0.052
"META Platforms, Facebook.",A downgraded Meta AI arrives in Europe amid tight regulation,"Meta AI is now available to users in Europe, but in a downgraded version without image-based features. More details here.",https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/03/downgraded-meta-ai-rolling-out-europe.html,2025-03-20,"Meta, Facebook’s parent company, is mainly known for its social media and messaging platforms. However, it has been committed to developing artificial intelligence for some time. Meta AI is its main product for the consumer market. That said, the firm had been unable to roll out Meta AI in Europe due to the continent’s strict regulatory rules, until now.

Europe receives less capable Meta AI due to regulations

After a long wait, Meta AI has finally arrived in the old continent. That said, it doesn’t have all the features available in other regions. The regulatory environment remains an obstacle for the company to overcome.

Meta AI has been available in the US since 2023. The firm has integrated it into its social platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and even WhatsApp. The chatbot offers the classic functions usually available on similar platforms. You can ask it questions, talk to it, ask it to generate images, or ask it to respond to questions about a specific image, for example.

However, Meta AI has been downgraded upon its arrival in the EU. The AI-powered chatbot will only offer text-based functions to users in 41 European countries and 21 overseas territories. This means they won’t be able to generate images or upload their own pictures for the chatbot to analyze and answer questions about. Text functions are still useful for receiving answers or tips. For example, you could ask the platform for some travel recommendations.

In 2023, Meta attempted to roll out its chatbot in Europe as well. However, a ruling from Ireland’s privacy watchdog forced the firm to stop it. The Meta AI’s European version did not use user data from Meta’s social platforms for its training.

“This launch follows almost a year of intensive engagement with various European regulators, and for now, we are only offering a text-only model in the region, which wasn’t trained on first-party data from users in the EU,” said Ellie Heatrick, spokesperson for Meta.

Meta wants to achieve feature parity

Still, the company’s goal is for European users to receive more features. “We will continue to work collaboratively with regulators so that people in Europe have access to and are properly served by Meta’s AI innovations that are already available to the rest of the world,” Heatrick said. She added that Meta will work to “find parity with the US.”",0.7787,0.019,0.943,0.038
"META Platforms, Facebook.",The EU is betraying its users and weakening their privacy for political gain,"Maybe Apple will never fully walk away from Europe, but the European Commission has just guaranteed that the citizens of its member states will always be the last to get new iPhone features — if they get them at all.Apple's headquarters in Ireland, in the Eur…",https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/03/19/the-eu-is-betraying-its-users-and-weakening-their-privacy-for-political-gain,2025-03-19,"Maybe Apple will never fully walk away from Europe, but the European Commission has just guaranteed that the citizens of its member states will always be the last to get new iPhone features — if they get them at all.

Even before its latest legal requirements, the European Commission (EC) has already put Apple in the position of keeping iPhone mirroring away from Europe, and delaying Apple Intelligence. But it's only going to get worse — and this is entirely the European Commission's fault.

Under the banner of protecting consumer and business interests, the EC has made it so that any firm would drop Europe to the bottom of its list of priorities.

But then of course, the new requirements do not apply to just any firm, they solely apply to Apple. They don't even apply to any other company that ostensibly falls under exactly the same Digital Markets Act (DMA) definition of a gatekeeper firm.

""The DMA regulates the actions of so-called gatekeepers,"" says the European Commission in its Q&A addition to the new stipulations. ""Gatekeepers are large online platforms that have been designated as such because they provide services — so called core platform services — to many European users.""

""The DMA lays down rules to ensure contestability and fairness for business users and end users,"" it continues. ""This includes an obligation on gatekeepers of operating systems to provide, free of charge, effective interoperability with the same hardware and software features available to services provided by the gatekeeper itself.""

Fine words, but incredibly they are not actually true words. Despite all the EC says, there are no such obligations on any gatekeeper, except Apple.

It's not as if Apple is some saintly organization. Look at its record with unions, or look at how it appears to Sherlock developers.

But the EC's new stipulations have nothing to do with Apple's actions, and have very little to do with fairness for consumers or businesses. They are about politics and the truly shocking gullibility of people who appear to believe whoever they spoke to last.

""The specified measures are based on extensive technical discussions between the Commission, Apple and numerous interested stakeholders, in particular developers,"" says the EC. ""The measures take into account feedback received from third parties on the importance of interoperability for certain iOS features and on Apple's handling of interoperability requests.""

""This constructive dialogue allowed the Commission to identify the measures that developers need to offer innovative products and services,"" it continues, ""while ensuring that end users maintain their known iPhone user experience and enjoy improved interoperability.""

Except it doesn't ensure that. It does the opposite of ensuring any of this.

By requiring Apple to provide interoperability on day one of any new feature or technology, it might as well be trying to ensure that there won't be a day one for users in Europe.

Apple will surely block more new features in the EU

Instead, as it has done before, Apple will roll out new features everywhere else in the world. And then, maybe turn to doing all of the extra work that the EC mandates.

Even if Apple delays features for the EU, its rivals operating within Europe could just wait until they can legally take what they want and apply it worldwide.

iPhone Mirroring in use in the US, but not in the EU

Apple has complained that there are already companies that solely copy Apple's technology. But now the EC is requiring Apple to give it to them, and do so for free.

By demanding that rivals get the same features at the same time as Apple, the EC is also forcing the company to delay introducing its own features to its own products.

The only way Apple can avoid having its intellectual property taken by anyone who wants it, is to not deploy that IP within the EU.

What the EC does and what it says it does

Both Apple and the EC say that they have worked together, but perhaps no one involved the Commission's communications department. There is a total disconnect between what the EC says it is doing, and what it is actually achieving.

For instance, the EC announcement quite grandly states that the obligations also encourage ""the gatekeepers to innovate its [sic] platform and its own products and services."" Note the singular ""its"" about Apple after the pretense of referring to gatekeeper firms, plural.

Plus, you can say it all you like, but what the EC has done must mean that Apple will at least slow down developing its offerings within the EU.

There is also an argument that the very same stipulations will curtail innovation from Apple's rivals. If all you have to do is ask Apple for a freebie, there's no incentive to invest money and time figuring out anything yourself.

So without question, EU users will become second-rate citizens as far as Apple devices and apps are concerned. Without much doubt, rival firms will cut back on their own research and development expecting government-mandated handouts from Apple, making the situation worse.

Making privacy and security impossible

But at least EU citizens will be protected — except, they won't. Rivals are now allowed to ask for access to pretty much anything they like on the iPhone, and presumably Apple has to have very good reason to refuse it.

Whereas it appears that rivals do not have to offer any reason at all for why they want certain access. As Apple points out, Meta has already requested access to more than a dozen privacy-sensitive technologies to do with CarPlay, iPhone mirroring, or devices connected via Bluetooth.

The EU must know this, but it doesn't appear to have asked Meta why, for one single example, it wants access to an iPhone user's Wi-Fi network details. There is no benefit at all to a Facebook user of surrendering this information.

Whereas there potentially is a lot of profit for Meta in being able to determine where a user is now, where they go to work, and where they shop.

You'd have thought that if the EC cared about consumers, it would care about their privacy. You would have thought that if the EC institutes legal requirements against gatekeeper companies, that it would apply these stipulations to all of them.

It's not like there are all that many. Currently there are six — and Facebook/Meta is one of them. The others are:

Alphabet/Google

Amazon

Microsoft

ByteDance

There's a perhaps surprising, perhaps not, lack of European companies on this list. Spotify should be on it, for instance.

What happens next

The European Union could be admired for how it has implemented regulations controlling Big Tech where practically the rest of the world is just talking about it a lot. But what the EC has now demonstrated is that this is not about controlling Big Tech for the benefit of its citizens.

As Tim Cook once, and quite uncharacteristically, said of the EU and Ireland's tax dispute, this is all ""total political crap.""

The thing with politics is that it comes with righteous and grandiose claims, usually accompanied with politicians wrapping themselves in the appropriately-colored flag, but then a collapse under pressure. And of those six gatekeeper firms, five of them are American, so it's not likely that laws letting rivals walk away with technology is going to go uncontested by these companies with armies of lawyers, and funding in equal measure.

It may even become contested within the EU itself. For in mid-2026, Ireland takes over the presidency of the Union, and Tim Cook has already said that will be ""a significant milestone.""

So, we'll see in time how this develops. In the short-term, though, the law appears to be a clumsy effort at attacking US big tech, with no gain for anybody but politicians and losses for everybody else.",0.9963,0.062,0.833,0.105

Have you ever looked around your home and wondered what to do with all the things you no longer use? Maybe it’s that barely-touched coffee maker in the corner or the stack of books gathering dust on your shelf. We’ve all been there—holding onto items we don’t need, unsure of how to part with them. Selling on Facebook Marketplace is an effective way to reach a broad audience and manage your sales with ease.

It’s not just another selling platform; it’s a simple, accessible way to turn your unused belongings into cash while connecting with people in your local community.

But let’s be honest—selling online can feel overwhelming at first. How do you create a listing that stands out? What’s the best way to price your items? And how do you stay safe while meeting buyers? Don’t worry; you’re not alone in these concerns. This step-by-step guide will walk you through everything you need to know, from crafting the perfect listing to managing buyer interactions with confidence. By the end, you’ll feel ready to dive into Facebook Marketplace and make the most of this powerful tool.

Getting Started with Facebook Marketplace

TL;DR Key Takeaways : Access Facebook Marketplace through your Facebook account to browse or create listings, making sure you’re signed in for full functionality.

Create compelling listings by selecting the right category, uploading high-quality photos, and providing detailed information like price, condition, and description.

Enhance your listings with optional features such as personalization, inventory tracking, and clear meetup preferences to attract more buyers.

Use the seller dashboard to manage listings, track performance, respond to inquiries, and update details as needed for better engagement.

Prioritize safety during meetups by choosing public locations, informing someone of your plans, and using secure payment methods to ensure smooth transactions.

To access Facebook Marketplace, log in to your Facebook account. On the desktop version, locate the “Marketplace” option in the main menu. Clicking on it will take you to the platform, where you can browse listings or create your own. For mobile users, the Marketplace icon is typically found at the bottom of the app interface. Ensure you are signed in to unlock all features, such as managing your listings and communicating with potential buyers.

Before diving in, familiarize yourself with the platform’s policies and guidelines. Facebook Marketplace prohibits the sale of certain items, such as alcohol, tobacco, and counterfeit goods. Adhering to these rules ensures your listings remain active and visible to buyers.

How to Create a Listing

Creating a listing on Facebook Marketplace is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to get started:

Click “Create New Listing” on the Marketplace homepage.

Select the appropriate category for your item, such as electronics, furniture, or clothing. Proper categorization ensures your listing appears in relevant searches.

Upload high-quality photos of your item. Use clear, well-lit images from multiple angles to showcase the item’s condition and features.

Write a concise and descriptive title. For instance, “Brand New Coffee Maker” or “Pre-Owned Leather Sofa” is more effective than vague titles like “Appliance for Sale.”

A well-crafted listing is the first step to attracting potential buyers. High-quality visuals and a clear title can significantly boost interest in your item.

Enhance your knowledge on Meta products by exploring a selection of articles and guides on the subject.

Adding Detailed Information

Once you’ve uploaded photos and added a title, focus on providing detailed information about your item. Comprehensive details not only make your listing more appealing but also reduce the number of questions from buyers. Include the following:

Price: Set a competitive price based on the item’s condition and market trends. Facebook Marketplace provides pricing suggestions to help you stay competitive.

Set a competitive price based on the item’s condition and market trends. Facebook Marketplace provides pricing suggestions to help you stay competitive. Condition: Clearly state whether the item is “new,” “used,” or “refurbished.” Transparency builds trust and encourages serious inquiries.

Clearly state whether the item is “new,” “used,” or “refurbished.” Transparency builds trust and encourages serious inquiries. Description: Write a detailed description that highlights key features, dimensions, brand, and any defects. For example, if selling a dining table, mention its material, size, and any visible scratches or wear.

Accuracy and thoroughness in your listing can help you attract serious buyers and streamline the selling process.

Enhancing Your Listing with Additional Features

Facebook Marketplace offers optional features to make your listing stand out. These enhancements can improve visibility and buyer engagement:

Boosted Listings: Consider using Facebook’s paid promotion tools to increase your listing’s visibility and reach a larger audience.

Using these features strategically can make your listing more appealing and improve the overall buyer experience.

Publishing and Managing Your Listings

Before publishing your listing, review it carefully to ensure all details are accurate and visually appealing. Once satisfied, click “Publish” to make your item visible to potential buyers.

After publishing, use Facebook’s seller dashboard to manage your listings effectively. This tool allows you to:

Monitor the performance of your listings, including views and inquiries.

Respond promptly to buyer messages using the built-in chat feature.

Edit your listing if you need to update details or address common buyer questions.

Staying active and responsive on the platform can help you close sales more efficiently and build a positive reputation as a seller.

Prioritizing Safety During Transactions

Safety is paramount when meeting buyers in person or completing transactions. Follow these best practices to ensure a secure experience:

Arrange meetups in well-lit, public locations, such as shopping centers or police station parking lots.

Schedule meetings during daylight hours whenever possible.

Inform a trusted friend or family member about the meeting details, and consider bringing someone with you.

Avoid sharing sensitive personal information, such as your home address, unless absolutely necessary.

By taking these precautions, you can minimize risks and feel more confident during in-person interactions.

Making sure Secure Payments

To protect yourself financially, use secure payment methods. Here are some guidelines to follow:

Accept cash or trusted digital payment platforms like PayPal, Venmo, or Zelle.

Avoid accepting checks, as they can be fraudulent or bounce after the transaction.

If shipping is involved, use a reliable courier service and confirm payment before sending the item.

By adhering to these practices, you can reduce the likelihood of payment disputes and ensure a smooth transaction process.

Maximizing Your Success on Facebook Marketplace

Selling on Facebook Marketplace offers a convenient way to connect with buyers and manage your sales efficiently. By creating detailed and visually appealing listings, using optional features, and adhering to safety protocols, you can optimize your selling experience.

Here’s your Tuesday Tech Drop, my weekly roundup of the past week’s top stories from the intersection of politics and technology.

Musk’s expanding Starlink footprint

The New York Times reports that Elon Musk’s Starlink internet service has been implemented at the White House complex as Starlink’s footprint expands across the federal government. Seems pretty dangerous considering that Musk appears to have the ability to turn the terminals off at will, a prospect that gained attention when he openly pondered how Ukraine would fare in defending itself from Russia’s invasion if the Starlink terminals it’s using were turned off.

Musk later added that Starlink would never shut off those terminals, but he already has prevented Ukraine from using the network for a drone attack, which raises justifiable questions about his parameters for U.S. government use. Sharing the Times’ report on Bluesky, technologist Waldo Jaquith wrote: “This is extremely bad.” Given how antidemocratic and self-absorbed Musk has been acting lately, it’s hard to disagree.

‘Careless People’ rises up the charts

Last week, Meta succeeded in getting an arbitrator to temporarily prevent Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former director of global public policy for Facebook, from promoting “Careless People,” her tell-all memoir about the social media giant. But that hasn’t stopped the book — which includes unflattering allegations about Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives — from flying off shelves.

I just wrote about how the book is rocketing up bestseller charts, despite Meta’s efforts. Read my report here.

The power of MAGA podcasters

A new study by liberal watchdog Media Matters for America shows how a constellation of right-wing influencers “dominates the online media ecosystem, seeping into sports, comedy, and other supposedly nonpolitical spaces.” The report speaks to a trend I’ve been following closely: the rise of podcasters as key spokespeople for Donald Trump’s illiberal movement.

Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters, shared the graphic below, highlighting the outsize influence that right-wing content creators have online — aided in part by social platforms led by MAGA-friendly executives such as Zuckerberg.

Pentagon press secretary’s extremism on display

Speaking of podcasters, Politico resurfaced largely unnoticed comments made last year by Pentagon deputy press secretary Kingsley Wilson, who has a history of spreading racist and antisemitic conspiracy theories. On a podcast last year, Wilson praised a white rancher accused of killing an unarmed immigrant who he said trespassed on his property. I previously wrote about the rancher, George Alan Kelly, and how he became a cause célèbre among conservatives after his case ended in a mistrial.

In the clip below, Wilson is quoted as saying Kelly should receive the Medal of Honor, which is the U.S. military’s highest decoration.

Trump admin deletes page on gun violence

Trump’s White House has deleted a government webpage identifying gun violence — a leading cause of death for children and teens in the United States — as a public health issue. The page, maintained during the Biden administration, included details about the devastatingly broad impact of gun violence on children and American families.

Gabbard’s ties to far-right influencers in focus

U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard reportedly tried — and failed — to install a pro-Kremlin podcaster as one of her deputies to lead the country’s top intelligence agencies.

OpenAI tries to weaken copyright regulations

OpenAI, the company led by Trump-friendly CEO Sam Altman, is pressuring the White House to alter government regulations in a way that would make it easier for U.S. companies to use copyrighted material to train their artificial intelligence models. The idea is fundamentally opposed by many media outlets and artists, who accuse AI companies of essentially stealing their work.

FBI reportedly sought freezes on accounts

Citibank says the FBI recommended that it temporarily freeze the bank accounts of various climate grant recipients after being told that the Environmental Protection Agency fund that issued the grants was under a criminal investigation. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said last week that the agency had terminated $20 billion in grants from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, stoking fear about the Trump administration’s ability to weaponize the government against its political opponents.

"META Platforms, Facebook.","FTC Removes Posts Critical of Amazon, Microsoft, and AI Companies",Business-guidance content published during the Biden administration has been removed from the Federal Trade Commission website.,https://www.wired.com/story/federal-trade-commission-removed-blogs-critical-of-ai-amazon-microsoft/,2025-03-18,"The Trump administration’s Federal Trade Commission has removed four years’ worth of business guidance blogs as of Tuesday morning, including important consumer protection information related to artificial intelligence and the agency’s landmark privacy lawsuits under former chair Lina Khan against companies like Amazon and Microsoft. More than 300 blogs were removed.

On the FTC’s website, the page hosting all of the agency’s business-related blogs and guidance no longer includes any information published during former president Joe Biden’s administration, current and former FTC employees, who spoke under anonymity for fear of retaliation, tell WIRED. These blogs contained advice from the FTC on how big tech companies could avoid violating consumer protection laws.

One now deleted blog, titled “Hey, Alexa! What are you doing with my data?” explains how, according to two FTC complaints, Amazon and its Ring security camera products allegedly leveraged sensitive consumer data to train the ecommerce giant’s algorithms. (Amazon disagreed with the FTC’s claims.) It also provided guidance for companies operating similar products and services. Another post titled “$20 million FTC settlement addresses Microsoft Xbox illegal collection of kids’ data: A game changer for COPPA compliance” instructs tech companies on how to abide by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act by using the 2023 Microsoft settlement as an example. The settlement followed allegations by the FTC that Microsoft obtained data from children using Xbox systems without the consent of their parents or guardians.

“In terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,” a source familiar tells WIRED.

Another removed FTC blog titled “The Luring Test: AI and the engineering of consumer trust” outlines how businesses could avoid creating chatbots that violate the FTC Act’s rules against unfair or deceptive products. This blog won an award in 2023 for “excellent descriptions of artificial intelligence.”

The Trump administration has received broad support from the tech industry. Big tech companies like Amazon and Meta, as well as tech entrepreneurs like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, all donated to Trump’s inauguration fund. Other Silicon Valley leaders, like Elon Musk and David Sacks, are officially advising the administration. Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employs technologists sourced from Musk’s tech companies. And already, federal agencies like the General Services Administration have started to roll out AI products like GSAi, a general-purpose government chatbot.

The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.

Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at makenakelly.32.

Removing blogs raises serious compliance concerns under the Federal Records Act and the Open Government Data Act, one former FTC official tells WIRED. During the Biden administration, FTC leadership would place “warning” labels above previous administrations’ public decisions it no longer agreed with, the source said, fearing that removal would violate the law.

Since President Donald Trump designated Andrew Ferguson to replace Khan as FTC chair in January, the Republican regulator has vowed to leverage his authority to go after big tech companies. Unlike Khan, however, Ferguson’s criticisms center around the Republican party’s long-standing allegations that social media platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, censor conservative speech online. Before being selected as chair, Ferguson told Trump that his vision for the agency also included rolling back Biden-era regulations on artificial intelligence and tougher merger standards, The New York Times reported in December.

In an interview with CNBC last week, Ferguson argued that content moderation could equate to an antitrust violation. “If companies are degrading their product quality by kicking people off because they hold particular views, that could be an indication that there's a competition problem,” he said.

Sources speaking with WIRED on Tuesday claimed that tech companies are the only groups who benefit from the removal of these blogs.

“They are talking a big game on censorship. But at the end of the day, the thing that really hits these companies’ bottom line is what data they can collect, how they can use that data, whether they can train their AI models on that data, and if this administration is planning to take the foot off the gas there while stepping up its work on censorship,” the source familiar alleges. “I think that's a change big tech would be very happy with.”",0.8773,0.051,0.878,0.071
"META Platforms, Facebook.",Snap CEO Evan Spiegel explains his joke job title on LinkedIn,Snap CEO Evan Spiegel's LinkedIn briefly said he was a product VP at Meta. He explained to Bloomberg what was behind the post.,https://www.businessinsider.com/snap-evan-spiegel-linkedin-meta-product-vp-copycat-features-2025-3,2025-03-18,"This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Evan Spiegel doesn't work at Meta, but if you're looking at his LinkedIn, you might have thought he did.

The Snap cofounder and CEO said in an interview with Bloomberg published Monday that one of his employees temporarily put on his profile that he was ""VP Product @ Meta"" as a gag. (His LinkedIn profile no longer shows that.)

The joke appears to be a dig at Meta, which has taken a few pages from Snapchat's book over the years when it comes to features.

For example, Snapchat was the first to introduce user Stories that disappear after a while, rolling out a feature in 2013 that let users post photos and videos that'd vanish after 24 hours.

Meta in 2016 unveiled its own Stories feature on Instagram, and Facebook got them the following year. WhatsApp debuted a similar feature called Status also in 2017.

Facebook offered to buy Snapchat for $3 billion in 2013, but Spiegel's company declined. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg reached out to Spiegel in 2016 to try again.

Zuckerberg has been asked about the striking similarities between some of the companies' offerings before.

In a 2017 earnings call, he talked about what was at the time called Facebook's Camera Effects Platform.

""I think we were a little bit late to the trend initially around making cameras the center of how sharing works,"" he said. ""But I do think at this point we're pretty much ahead in terms of the technology that we're building, and making an open platform, I think, is a big step forward. A lot of people are using these products across our family of apps. And I would expect us to continue leading the way forward on this from this point on.""

Snapchat had previously unveiled animated AR selfie masks and filters.

More recently, Snapchat showed off its newest AR glasses, called Spectacles, last year, days before Zuckerberg announced Meta's competing Orion glasses.

"META Platforms, Facebook.","Meta vows to curtail false content, deepfakes ahead of Australia election","SYDNEY : Facebook and Instagram-owner Meta Platforms said on Tuesday its independent fact-checking program in Australia would help detect and remove false content and deepfakes, as it aims to curb misinformation ahead of a national election due by May.In a bl…",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/meta-vows-curtail-false-content-deepfakes-ahead-australia-election-5007826,2025-03-18,"SYDNEY : Facebook and Instagram-owner Meta Platforms said on Tuesday its independent fact-checking program in Australia would help detect and remove false content and deepfakes, as it aims to curb misinformation ahead of a national election due by May.

In a blog post, the social media company said any content that could lead to imminent violence and physical harm, and interfere with voting would be removed, while the distribution of misleading content through its platforms would be curtailed.

""When content is debunked by fact-checkers, we attach warning labels to the content and reduce its distribution in Feed and Explore so it is less likely to be seen,"" said Cheryl Seeto, Meta's Head of Policy in Australia.

News agencies Agence France-Presse and the Australian Associated Press will review the content for Meta, Seeto said.

Meta scrapped its U.S. fact-checking programs in January and reduced curbs on discussions around contentious topics such as immigration and gender identity, bowing to pressure from conservatives to implement the biggest overhaul of its approach to managing political content on its services.

Besides fake content, social media companies are also fighting to contain deepfakes - hyper-realistic videos, photographs or audio generated through AI algorithms that are presented as real.

Meta said any deepfake content that violates its policies would be removed, or rated ""altered"" and then ranked down in its feed to limit its distribution. Users will also be prompted to disclose when they post or share AI-generated content.

""For content that doesn't violate our policies, we still believe it's important for people to know when photorealistic content they're seeing has been created using AI,"" Seeto said.

Opinion polls show a close-run election in Australia with the opposition Liberal-National coalition ahead of the ruling centre-left Labor party by a narrow margin.

Meta's approach in Australia is consistent with its efforts to prevent misinformation during the recent elections in India, Britain and the United States, Seeto said.

Meta is facing multiple regulatory headwinds in Australia with the government planning to impose a levy on big tech firms to compensate for advertising revenue they generate from sharing local news content.

Meta and other social media firms must also enforce a ban for users under 16 by the end of this year with the companies consulting the government on how they should roll the restrictions.",-0.9491,0.087,0.864,0.049
"META Platforms, Facebook.",The Anti-DEI Agenda Is Reprogramming America,President Trump’s anti-DEI playbook doesn’t just affect the makeup of America’s workplaces. It also impacts cultural production. Just ask Netflix’s former head of diversity.,https://www.wired.com/story/anti-dei-agenda-reprogramming-america/,2025-03-17,"It would be silly to think, in this time of spectacular fools, that the Donald Trump administration mandate to kill diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs was simply a workplace issue. What’s happening is bigger than that, says Vernā Myers, and it will have implications for years to come. The US government has declared war on American culture.

The removal of DEI efforts doesn’t just impact the workforces at specific companies, it also impacts what those companies produce, their cultural output. Removing diversity programs limits the voices present when decisions are made about features on social media platforms or what TV show to make. But for Myers, a longtime consultant and cultural strategist who served as Netflix’s vice president of inclusion strategy from 2018 to 2023, the administration’s anti-DEI agenda is “not about how DEI is practiced.”

“This is about the principles of equality and inclusion for all,” Myers says. “This is, ‘We are going to take down the structure of values that DEI is associated with, and by doing so we are going to pull back your civil rights.’”

Trump made a target of DEI on day one, signing an executive order to end “radical and wasteful” preferencing in federal agencies. He followed that up with another order aimed squarely at DEI programs in the private sector. His attorney general Pam Bondi has called for investigations into companies that uphold DEI standards.

A federal judge subsequently blocked Trump’s DEI orders, but that hasn’t stopped companies from scaling back on their initiatives. Warner Bros. Discovery changed the title of its DEI program to simply “Inclusion.” Paramount put a stop to several policies. Disney changed the diversity and inclusion factors it used to determine executive compensation. Per a report in Axios, the company also altered some of the content advisory disclaimers that ran before older titles on Disney+.

Companies like Meta, meanwhile, were eager to embrace a corporate culture of “masculine energy,” because it aligns with the Trump administration’s “warrior” ethos. It also preemptively ditched its third-party fact-checking program and paid moderators in favor of a system that is similar to Community Notes on X. The move, coupled with changes to its Community Guidelines, has exposed users across Facebook, Threads, and Instagram to more hate speech and abuse.

In Hollywood, there is a shift happening, a move toward programming geared to Trump’s America. Law-and-order shows are making a comeback (Prime Video’s On Call; A+E’s Ozark Law) as broadcast-style TV slowly reasserts its dominance. Even the first breakout show of the year—Paradise on Hulu—is all about keeping order in a world ripped apart by nuclear warfare and climate disaster. Rolling back the studios’ diversity initiatives will likely only ensure this continues.

Last month, Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr, a Trump loyalist who previously said he would end the agency’s DEI efforts if appointed, opened a probe into NBC parent company Comcast, promising to take action against the telecom giant if it found “any programs that promote invidious forms of DEI.”",-0.4385,0.065,0.874,0.061

The community-driven feature replaced the company’s biased left-wing “fact checking” system that was used to censor conservatives over the past 10 years.

On Tuesday, Meta will begin releasing its own version of X’s “Community Notes” feature on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads for U.S. users, according to a report by TechCrunch.

Instead of relying on biased, third party so-called “fact-checkers,” a Community Notes feature allows social media users to add additional context to a post that might be misleading or contain wrong information.

That way, the public is entrusted to discuss issues and figure things out for themselves, rather than a third-party “fact-checker” outright banning or censoring content — which in practice was used to censor conservatives.

Notably, Elon Musk’s X has been relying on this type of crowd-sourcing of information as the social media platform’s sole means for correcting information since the SpaceX CEO bought the company.

And that method has apparently worked out well, as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is now seeking to emulate X’s Community Notes on his social media platforms.

As Breitbart News reported, Meta announced three weeks ago that social media users could sign up to be a part of the Community Notes system on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.

This came after the company scrapped its third-party “fact checking” system, with Zuckerberg himself saying they “have just been too politically biased, and have destroyed more trust than they’ve created, especially in the U.S.”

“The recent elections feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech,” the Meta CEO said in a video posted to his Instagram account earlier this year, adding that his company will therefore be “restoring free expression on our platforms.”

“We’re going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with Community Notes, similar to X,” Zuckerberg revealed.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Meta to test ‘Community Notes’ using algorithm from Elon Musk’s X,Tech giant says it expects new feature to be 'less biased' than previous third-party fact-checking program.,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/3/14/meta-to-test-community-notes-using-algorithm-from-elon-musks-x,2025-03-14,"Tech giant says it expects new feature to be ‘less biased’ than previous third-party fact-checking program.

Meta has said that its “Community Notes” feature intended to replace third-party fact checkers will use the open-source algorithm developed by Elon Musk’s X.

Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg announced the moderation shake-up in January amid a flurry of moves by Big Tech to ingratiate itself with United States President Donald Trump’s administration.

The move followed years of accusations by conservatives that fact-checking efforts often labelled legitimate viewpoints as misinformation for political or ideological reasons.

While Meta’s announcement was welcomed by Trump and many conservatives, misinformation scholars warned that the move would add to the tidal wave of false claims and fake news online.

In a blog post on Thursday, Meta said that using X’s technology for the crowdsourced fact-checking tool would allow it to “improve it for our own platforms over time”.

“As our own version develops, we may explore different or adjusted algorithms to support how Community Notes are ranked and rated,” Meta said.

“We’re building this in the open while learning from contributors and seeing how it works in practice in our products. We don’t expect this process to be perfect but we’ll continue to improve as we learn.”

Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, said that it would begin testing the feature on March 18 and that 200,000 potential contributors had signed up so far to help assess the accuracy of content on its platforms.

The California-based tech giant said notes would not be published unless they are deemed accurate by contributors with a diverse range of viewpoints.

“We expect Community Notes to be less biased than the third party fact checking program it replaces, and to operate at a greater scale when it is fully up and running,” Meta said.

“When we launched the fact checking program in 2016, we were clear that we didn’t want to be the arbiters of truth and believed that turning to expert fact checking organizations was the best solution available.”

Meta said the new feature will be rolled out across the US after beta testing and it plans to eventually introduce the feature for all users worldwide.",0.9854,0.027,0.867,0.106

The numbers are staggering, but what do they really mean?

Digiday has sifted through the data to find the numbers that actually matter. Here’s what you need to know:

YouTube has become huge

Over the past 20 years, YouTube has cemented itself as one of the most dominant platforms in the digital landscape. Launched in 2005, the same year as Reddit and just a year after Facebook, it emerged at a time when social media was still a novelty.

Fast forward to 2025, and YouTube is a content powerhouse. Every minute, an average of 500 hours of video is uploaded, according to the platform. A growing share of that (35%) is in 4k resolution, a trend YouTube actively encourages, especially as more people watch on TV screens.

YouTube reaches over 100 countries in 80 different languages. In several EMEA markets, for example, the majority of watch time comes from international audiences — more than 70% of YouTube viewing in the U.K., Spain and Nigeria happens outside of those countries.

It shows that language barriers are becoming less of an issue on the platform. AI-powered dubbing technology is reshaping how users consume content, with watch time increasing by 40% when viewers opt for dubbed videos.

Like other platforms, YouTube’s success relies on its algorithm. When the company introduced its first recommendation engine in 2008, it simply prioritized popular videos. Today, the system is far more sophisticated, leveraging over 80 billion signals to match users with content they’re most likely to engage with.

YouTube considers itself to be the new television

This narrative isn’t new, but it’s certainly something YouTube is proudly shouting about, especially after Nielsen ranked it as the No. 1 streaming platform in the U.S. for 12 consecutive months when it comes to watch time. Nielsen’s report, which came out in February 2024, revealed that YouTube took an average of 9.2% of total TV usage, ahead of other major streamers including Netflix (8.2%), Amazon Prime (3.5%) and Disney+ (2%). YouTube has since backed that status up with its claim that more than 1 billion hours of YouTube content are watched daily on TV screens in the U.S.

When YouTube launched in 2005, the platform had about 30,000 viewers a day. But today, the streaming giant boasts more than 2 billion daily active users and over 1 billion monthly podcast users.

And it’s not just YouTube’s long-form content that is watched on TV screens. Despite Shorts being a vertical video format, 15% of Shorts videos are now watched in the living room.

YouTube is still king when it comes to creator monetization

Most platforms keep their revenue sharing deals and creator fund participation numbers under wraps, but YouTube takes a different approach.

Currently, YouTube’s Partner Program (YPP), which is a well-established revenue share program, has 3 million creators. And 500,000 of those have been on YouTube for more than a decade.

YouTube is doing pretty well when it comes to subscriptions

Subscriptions are often seen as an alternative revenue stream so platforms don’t have to be solely reliant on ad dollars, but making subscriptions a sustainable business remains a challenge for many, from Meta to X.

But for YouTube, since introducing its Premium and Music subscription plans in 2014 and 2015 respectively, the platform has been able to reach 125 million global subscribers so far, including trials.

YouTube impacts the economy, and its got creators to thank for that

Twenty years ago, being a creator was considered more of a hobby alongside school or a full-time job, rather than a real career.

That’s no longer the case. With Europe’s creator economy projected to reach $41.17 billion by 2030 and U.S. influencer marketing expected to grow 14.2% to $9.29 billion this year, according to eMarketer, it’s clear why YouTube is focused on staying ahead in the creator space.

Part of that plan involves doubling down on YouTube’s ability to thrust creators into the cultural mainstream. Which is why the platform has said that creators are becoming the startups of Hollywood. Whether it’s scripting, editing behind the scenes or creators are hiring various staff as part of their new business — YouTube wants to be the launchpad.

As such, YouTube contributed more than $45 billion to the U.S. GDP in 2023, according to Oxford Economics, and it created more than 430,000 full-time jobs.

Similarly, in Europe, YouTube contributed €6.4 billion ($6.94 billion) to the EU’s GDP in 2023, according to the platform’s latest Impact report, not including the jobs created by the 100,000 creators in the region that have built their own businesses including hiring staff.",0.9979,0.003,0.884,0.113

If you are already sharing photos and videos on your Facebook Stories, turning that into a way to make some extra cash sounds like a pretty smooth deal.

Bluesky is taking another shot at the Mark Zuckerbergs of the tech world.

During the week of SXSW in Austin, Bluesky CEO Jay Graber donned a black T-shirt imprinted with a Latin phrase: ""Mundus sine caesaribus"" or ""A world without Ceasars.""

The shirt appeared to reference the Meta CEO, who wore a similar boxy, black T-shirt with a Latin phrase likening himself to Roman general Julius Caesar: ""Aut Zuck aut nihil"" or ""Either Zuck or nothing.""

On Thursday afternoon, Bluesky started slinging the same shirt Graber wore at the Austin conference. The shirt sold out within 30 minutes, according to Bluesky spokesperson Emily Liu.

Liu told BI that the shirt signaled the ethos of the social media platform.

""Jay wore the shirt onstage at SXSW to emphasize Bluesky's democratic approach, where a single CEO or company doesn't control your experience online — and looks like people resonated with that vision,"" Liu said in an email.

Graber said in a Bluesky post that sales of the shirt launched while she was on a flight and sold out before she landed.

The company declined to share how many shirts it sold.

Since Twitter rebranded to X after Elon Musk's 2022 takeover, some users have decamped to alternative social media platforms like Bluesky. Meta, the parent company of social platforms Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram, launched its X alternative, Threads, in 2023.

Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have something new in common.

It turns out Meta is following in X's footsteps on community notes, right down to the algorithm.

Zuckerberg said in a blog post on Thursday that Meta will use the open-source algorithm from Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter, as the basis of its new content moderation system.

""We won't be reinventing the wheel,"" the company said. ""This will allow us to build on what X has created and improve it for our own platforms over time.""

It added that it might experiment with different or adjusted algorithms as it goes.

Meta will start testing community notes in the US on March 18. Meta

The company says it'll begin testing community notes on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads in the US on March 18.

Meta said roughly 200,000 people in the US have signed up as contributors to the program, and the waiting list is still open. Meta will ""gradually and randomly"" begin choosing people from the waiting list and will test the writing and rating system before allowing any community notes to be posted publicly.

The company says community notes will be published only if users with a range of viewpoints agree they provide useful context. Notes will be limited to 500 characters and require a link to supporting material.

Meta announced in January that it was overhauling its approach to content moderation by replacing third-party fact-checking with crowdsourced community notes, a move that many interpreted as a rightward shift for its platforms.

At the time, Zuckerberg praised Musk's approach to content moderation on X, and signaled Meta's platforms would adopt a similar model.

""We expect Community Notes to be less biased than the third-party fact-checking program it replaces because it allows more people with more perspectives to add context to posts,"" Meta's blog post said.

Dozens of fact-checking organizations have warned the changes could lead to more misinformation spreading on the sites, which are some of the world's most popular social media platforms.

Musk bought Twitter in October 2022 and subsequently fired 80% of the platform's staff, including many people working on content moderation. Previously known as Birdwatch, the community notes feature began rolling out worldwide in December 2022.",0.8777,0.03,0.914,0.057

The plaintiffs allege that Meta used their copyrighted works without authorization to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models, marking a significant legal challenge in the realm of AI development and intellectual property rights.

Details of the Allegations

The lawsuit was initiated by three major organizations: the National Publishing Union (SNE), the National Union of Authors and Composers (SNAC), and the Society of Men of Letters (SGDL). These groups represent a substantial portion of France's publishing industry and literary community. They claim that Meta engaged in ""massive use of copyrighted works without authorization"" to develop its generative AI models, which power features across Meta's platforms. The associations argue that such practices constitute a violation of copyright laws and amount to economic ""parasitism.""

Specific Concerns Raised by the Plaintiffs

The plaintiffs are particularly concerned about the unauthorized use of their members' works in Meta's AI training data. Vincent Montagne, president of the SNE, highlighted that numerous works from their members have appeared in Meta's data pool without permission. François Peyrony, president of SNAC, emphasized the necessity of the lawsuit to protect members from AI systems that ""plunder their works and cultural heritage to train themselves.""

Legal Context and Broader Implications

This lawsuit is the first of its kind against an AI giant in France, but is not the first time legal actions have targeted AI training practices. In the United States, Meta is facing similar lawsuits, including one filed by American actress and author Sarah Silverman and other authors, alleging misuse of their books to train its large language model, Llama.

The outcome of this case could have significant implications for the tech industry, potentially setting new legal standards for the use of copyrighted materials in AI training. It underscores the ongoing tension between technological advancement and the protection of intellectual property rights, highlighting the need for clear regulations that balance innovation with the rights of content creators.

Meta's Response and Future Outlook

As of now, Meta has not publicly responded to the lawsuit. The company has previously faced scrutiny over its AI training practices, with allegations of using copyrighted content without proper authorization. The resolution of this case may influence how Meta and other tech companies approach AI development, particularly concerning the sourcing and use of training data.

This legal challenge serves as a critical reminder of the complexities at the intersection of technology and intellectual property law, emphasizing the importance of establishing ethical and legal frameworks that support both innovation and the rights of creators.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Social Media Is Flooded With AI Doctor ‘Scams.’ Creators Can’t Stand It,"As AI content creation tools get easier to access, creators tell Rolling Stone platforms have a responsibility to take more proactive steps against it",http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-doctor-videos-tiktok-avatars-internet-safety-1235294841/,2025-03-13,"When mom and creator Cathy Pedrayes was scrolling TikTok around Christmas, she started to notice a surplus of accounts using AI avatars to promote knockoff products. Since it was the holiday shopping season, she thought little of it — until she stumbled across a video that felt equal parts ridiculous and dangerous. It was a clip of a woman claiming to have spent 13 years as a “butt doctor” revealing secret advice she learned during her residency. Her magic solution: a supplement from Amazon to fight iron deficiency, and a health newsletter that promised tips for weight loss, a clean gut, and better health. Pedrayes knew it was fake. But she also saw that it had 5.2 million views. And a quick search revealed another worry: there were hundreds more just like it.

@cathypedrayes Millions of people watched this video, it was promoted as a result and I’m hoping no one bought what they’re selling. This is AI. It’s fake and I’m noticing a ton of accounts using this tactic. • They repost the same kind of clickbait headline about a spouse cheating, weight loss or something that sounds weird like ‘butt doctor.’ • They build up the account as a ‘person’ and then change the username to a company. • At the end of the video they typically promote a health supplement and/or a newsletter. Even if you can’t tell what’s AI- if clickbait is a red flag for you, that’ll help protect you from AI garbage like this (& a lot of scams in general). #ai #scamalert #scammers #response #reaction #safetytips #onlinesafety #digitalsafety ♬ Not Like Us – Instrumental – DC Beatz

This discovery is one of the latest problems social media platforms are fighting since the development and democratization of artificial intelligence generators: AI doctor ads. AI is easier than ever to produce and as a result, ads with AI talking heads that claim to be medical experts are infiltrating social media’s robust wellness ecosystem. This isn’t isolated to one app. On Facebook, Instagram, X, and TikTok, a particular kind of AI health video — one that uses an AI avatar to convince people of medical expertise — has become the defacto way for accounts to convince people that they, and their unproven products, are legit. Unlike AI images from just a few years ago, many of these videos feature a combination of real footage and AI, which results in avatars who look extremely lifelike at first glance — and are edited exactly the same as direct to camera content that’s popular on video apps. For scrollers and creators alike, internet safety has always been a top concern. But as the technology develops and becomes harder to discern, several creators tell Rolling Stone it’s up to platforms to try and stop this type of AI spread — before it gets impossible to detect.

Editor’s picks

As a cosmetic chemist, Javon Ford shares his expertise with close to half-a-million followers on TikTok, debunking viral health and skincare claims. He posted about the AI doctors after realizing that many of the videos promoted harmful skincare fads like using beef tallow for sunscreen. With the help of people in his comments, Ford linked some of the videos to an app called Captions.ai which offers creators the ability to turn written prompts into videos from a variety of avatar hosts. These avatars can be searched by race, gender, and setting — giving users the opportunity to choose between people sitting in their cars, outside, or even walking down the street. They also don’t appear to be fully AI generated, but videos of real people that have their lips altered with AI to match the inputted script. Under Captions.ai’s Terms and Conditions, users are prohibited from “misrepresenting your identity or using [the app] to impersonate any other person,” but it’s unclear how those guidelines are enforced. (Representatives for Captions.ai did not respond to Rolling Stone’s requests for comment.)

For Ford, the worry is that these ads are multiplying in a social media atmosphere that’s already suffering from a lack of interest in context and critical thinking. “I’m not really concerned about AI competing in terms of content. I mean, have you ever asked Chat GPT a math question? My issue is that they’re not disclosing the AI in these ads or they’re just blatantly lying,” Ford tells Rolling Stone. “Scientific illiteracy is at an all time high. Literacy in general is pretty low, unfortunately. And it’s important that people are able to still think critically and become more vigilant and mindful about how we absorb this information.”

A recent report from journalism watchdog Media Matters found that dozens of accounts on TikTok use “wellness buzzwords,” AI-generated influencers, and fabricated personal testimonies to promote a variety of supplements and health products. Olivia Little, a senior investigative researcher at Media Matters and the author of the report, tells Rolling Stone that TikTok “wellness scams” have only gotten more elaborate in the past four years, something she considers incredibly dangerous. Related Content

“It’s a consumer safety issue as well as a user safety issue, because you have a network of companies or accounts impersonating anyone from a medical professional, like doctors, surgeons to, even more maliciously, providing fake or fabricated testimony,” Little says. “It’s all based on the false credibility that they’ve given themselves to, quite literally, trick the consumer.”

Advancements in artificial intelligence have developed rapidly in the past three years, as companies have made models available to the general public. But as AI gets sharper and harder to detect, social media companies haven’t developed guidelines for AI content at the same speed. Meta’s content guidelines for Facebook and Instagram require an AI label for any photo or video that’s been “digitally created, modified, or altered.” But a quick search of both platforms shows dozens of AI generated doctor videos without any disclosures and still raking in the views.

The same disclosure is also required on TikTok, which prohibits AI content that shows “fake authoritative sources” — like accounts that pretend to be doctors to promote supplements. After Media Matters published their report, the accounts they flagged were removed. A spokesperson for TikTok confirmed to Rolling Stone that the accounts were banned for violating the “Spam & Deceptive Behaviors” guidelines and removed additional profiles and videos flagged by this magazine. But one hour after TikTok removed the accounts, others continued to pop up. (Meta declined to comment.)

Pedrayes, who shares videos about consumer safety and advocacy to her 2 million followers, tells Rolling Stone that a lot of her content revolves around how to stay safe online, something she thinks will grow to encompass AI fronted claims as the programs, and videos, get more elaborate.

“Now I’m finding that just the basics of ‘Oh, I saw this video online. How do I know if it’s true?’ It seems like [people] are missing those skills,” she says. “I think from a platform space, it’s concerning that algorithms would promote this, and also that it would show up in other apps for other creators to kind of mimic that content.[Platforms] definitely have a responsibility to do more in toning this down.”",0.9948,0.074,0.811,0.115
"META Platforms, Facebook.","Testing Begins for Community Notes on Facebook, Instagram and Threads","On March 18th, we will begin testing our new crowd-sourced Community Notes approach.
The post Testing Begins for Community Notes on Facebook, Instagram and Threads appeared first on Meta.",https://about.fb.com/news/2025/03/testing-begins-community-notes-facebook-instagram-threads/,2025-03-13,"In January, Meta announced that we will end our third party fact checking program and move to a crowd-sourced Community Notes approach, starting in the United States. On March 18th, we will begin testing this new approach by allowing contributors from our community to write and rate notes on content across Facebook, Instagram and Threads.

This slideshow requires JavaScript.

We’re going to take time to do this right. Around 200,000 potential contributors in the US have signed up so far across all three apps, and the waitlist remains open for those who wish to take part in the program. But notes won’t initially appear on content. We will start by gradually and randomly admitting people off of the waitlist, and will take time to test the writing and rating system before any notes are published publicly.

How Do Community Notes Work?

Many of you will be familiar with X’s Community Notes system, in which users add context to posts. That’s the broad approach we are adopting.

Meta won’t decide what gets rated or written – contributors from our community will. And to safeguard against bias, notes won’t be published unless contributors with a range of viewpoints broadly agree on them.

This isn’t majority rules. No matter how many contributors agree on a note, it won’t be published unless people who normally disagree decide that it provides helpful context.

Community Notes will have a limit of 500 characters and will need to include a link to support the note.

This slideshow requires JavaScript.

To start with, notes won’t have author names attached to them. We want notes to be rated based on whether the context they add is helpful, not on who wrote them.

Contributors need to be over 18, have an account that’s more than 6 months old and in good standing, and either have a verified phone number or be enrolled in two-factor authentication.

The Community Notes feature will be available in 6 languages commonly used in the United States to start, including: English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French and Portuguese, and we will expand to other languages with time.

To start with, contributors will not be able to submit notes on advertisements. They can, however, write and submit notes on almost any other forms of content, including posts by Meta, our executives, politicians and other public figures.

How Are We Building Community Notes?

We won’t be reinventing the wheel. Initially we will use X’s open source algorithm as the basis of our rating system. This will allow us to build on what X has created and improve it for our own platforms over time.

The rating system will take into account each contributor’s rating history and evaluate which contributors normally disagree.

As X’s algorithm and program information is open source – meaning free and available for anyone to use – we can build on what X has done, learn from the researchers who have studied it, and improve the system for our own platforms. As our own version develops, we may explore different or adjusted algorithms to support how Community Notes are ranked and rated.

We’re building this in the open while learning from contributors and seeing how it works in practice in our products. We don’t expect this process to be perfect but we’ll continue to improve as we learn.

We expect Community Notes to be less biased than the third party fact checking program it replaces, and to operate at a greater scale when it is fully up and running. When we launched the fact checking program in 2016, we were clear that we didn’t want to be the arbiters of truth and believed that turning to expert fact checking organizations was the best solution available. But that’s not how it played out, particularly in the United States. Experts, like everyone else, have their own political biases and perspectives. This showed up in the choices some made about what to fact check and how.

Community Notes allow more people with more perspectives to add context to more types of content, and because publishing a note requires agreement between different people, we believe it will be less prone to bias. This requirement is also a safeguard against organized campaigns attempting to game the system and influence what notes get published or what they say.

Notes also won’t have penalties associated with them the way fact checks did. Fact checked posts often had their distribution across our platforms reduced. That won’t be the case with posts that have notes applied to them. Notes will provide extra context, but they won’t impact who can see the content or how widely it can be shared.

Our plan is to roll out Community Notes across the United States once we are comfortable from the initial beta testing that the program is working in broadly the way we believe it should, though we will continue to learn and improve it as we go. Once Notes begin to appear publicly, no new fact check labels from third party fact checkers will appear in the United States, though fact checkers are free to become Community Notes contributors alongside other users of our platform.

Our intention is ultimately to roll out this new approach to our users all over the world, but we won’t be doing that immediately. Until Community Notes are launched in other countries, the third party fact checking program will remain in place for them.",0.9991,0.018,0.841,0.141

It will let users write and rate notes to flag false or misleading content on Instagram, Facebook and Threads, shifting fact-checking from third-party teams to a crowd-sourced model.

Around 200,000 U.S. users have signed up to become potential contributors.

The switch to Community Notes is Meta's biggest overhaul in its approach to managing content in the recent past and comes as CEO Mark Zuckerberg tries to improve his relations with the Trump administration.

President Donald Trump, who has criticized social media firms for allegedly silencing conservative viewpoints on their platforms, had welcomed Meta's move in January.

To roll out the new system, Meta will use the open-source algorithm from X as the basis of its rating system. The rival social media platform had revamped its community-driven fact-checking feature Birdwatch to Community Notes in 2022.

Meta's Community Notes would be capped at 500 characters and initially available in six languages — English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French and Portuguese.

These notes will not have author names and will be published only if contributors with differing viewpoints agree that it provides helpful context.

Contributors must be more than 18 years old and should include a supporting link to post notes, Meta said, touting the system as ""less biased"" than the third-party fact-checking program.

Once Community Notes go live, third-party fact-check labels will no longer appear in the U.S., Meta said.

It’s been incredibly clear that they have regularly restricted conservative speech—whether it be as overt as silencing full media organizations for sharing the Hunter Biden laptop story or as unknown as suspending your grandmother’s Facebook account for sharing a “spicy” meme that criticizes Democrat policy.

After President Donald Trump’s sweeping victory in November, Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook parent company Meta, announced that the company would end its “third party fact-checking program and [move] to a Community Notes model.” This follows the successful strategy for allowing free speech in online discourse that Elon Musk took with X.

Zuckerberg in his announcement further added that Meta had been “over-enforcing our rules, limiting legitimate political debate, and censoring too much trivial content, and subjecting too many people to frustrating enforcement actions.”

He said that his platforms would “allow more speech by lifting restrictions on some topics that are part of mainstream discourse and focusing our enforcement on illegal and high-severity violations.”

Although we should applaud this move from Zuckerberg and his company, it doesn’t go far enough.

It’s not hyperbole to say that many conservative voices on a Meta platform have received fact-check strikes against their accounts.

I find my personal stories of censorship ridiculous but more common than one would imagine—every conservative I know has a similar experience:

When Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away in September 2020 during Trump’s first term, Democrats freaked out that the president would have the opportunity to replace her with someone more conservative, which he did with now-Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Reacting to their outrage, I tweeted the following opinion:

“Just a reminder that Ruth Bader Ginsburg could have casually retired at 80 yrs old under Obama and been replaced by an ultra-progressive in their 40s … but they chose not to.

“It’s not Republicans’ or Trump’s fault that they get the opportunity to push through a new justice.”

My opinion went viral—being posted hundreds of thousands of times on multiple platforms—when something curious happened. My opinion was “fact-checked” by third-party fact-checkers, and every screenshot of my tweet was flagged as “missing context.” USA Today had its fact-check division write an extensive piece about my opinion, even going as far as to interview law professors to “debunk” it.

This is how the Left has controlled the free flow of ideas on social media throughout the past decade—and many conservative accounts have been flagged, which limits their overall potential reach.

Both my Facebook and Instagram accounts have been flagged for sharing my opinion so many times that at one point, the now-Meta warned users not to follow me because I had posted “false information,” according to so-called independent fact-checkers.

At one point, my account was flagged for sharing “nudity or sexual content” because I shared a meme with Hunter Biden on it, was flagged for “bullying or harassment” because I posted my reply to the liberal Southern District of New York federal prosecutor who used her 14-year-old as pro-abortion propaganda, and was even flagged with a fact-check by the Australian Associated Press on a meme calling out climate change protesters as arsonists. The Australian Associated Press fact-checked said meme with an article about margarine turkey fattener.

Every account and every person who shared any of my content that was targeted by fact-checkers have the same strikes on their accounts.

Each of these actions against my accounts limited my reach and speech on all Meta platforms—and where at one point, according to their metrics, my Instagram alone reached over 55 million people per month, that reach diminished over 90%.

My accounts are just one example of thousands who have been given strikes and have been limited due to the blatant political bias of third-party fact-checkers. The loud, conservative online voices who have been restricted, muted, and deleted by the program continue to be so under Zuckerberg’s proposed changes to Meta’s platforms—and this needs to be corrected.

If Zuckerberg and the executives at Meta truly believe in free speech and open political discourse on their platforms—and if they truly believe that they have “over-enforced their rules,” then every account on all of their platforms that could potentially have fallen under that error must be given a clean slate.

If you’re serious about open political discourse, then it’s time to let everyone out of algorithm jail—and simply shifting away from your previous biased fact-checking process doesn’t solve that problem.

I want to believe that Mark Zuckerberg is genuine in his desire to correct for past mistakes, but in order truly do so, it’s the mistakes that must be corrected—not simply the enforcement mechanism.",0.9527,0.081,0.82,0.098
"META Platforms, Facebook.","Meta, Now Fact-Check Free, Is Testing X-Style Community Notes","The crowdsourced notes will appear on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads starting March 18.",https://gizmodo.com/meta-now-fact-check-free-is-testing-x-style-community-notes-2000575643,2025-03-13,"Earlier this year, Mark Zuckerberg said that, effectively, Meta was getting out of the ‘caring about the truth’ business and ditching third-party fact-checkers. Now it’s handing over the keys to its users. Meta announced that it will start to roll out a Community Notes feature, similar to the one on X, across its major social platforms.

Facebook, Instagram, and Threads will start to see community-written and rated fact checks appear on content—eventually. The test run for the feature will begin on March 18 and will focus on the note writing and ranking to work out the kinks before anything gets published. Meta claims that around 200,000 people have already signed up to a waitlist to join the pool of contributors for Community Notes, and it’ll start letting them in slowly through a random selection process as the feature gets introduced. The first languages approved for notes include English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French, and Portuguese.

According to the company, it’ll initially use the same open-source algorithm that is already used by X, with ratings taking into consideration the rating history of each user to help determine which notes will appear on the platform. Eligible users must have a Meta account that is at least six months old, in good standing, and has a verified phone number attached to the account with two-factor authentication activated.

Meta says that for a note to actually make it to the platform, it’ll have to receive approval from users with a “range of viewpoints” and, no matter how many contributors agree on a note, it’ll only get published if people who “normally disagree” say it is helpful. All notes will be capped at 500 characters and will be required to include a link that supports the content in the note.

Here’s the thing with community notes: It can actually work. A study from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign found that users on X were more willing to retract false posts in response to notes, and a study in PNAS Nexus last year found that community notes were perceived by users as significantly more trustworthy than misinformation flags or notes from third-party fact-checkers.

The problem with the community notes system is that it often turns into a platform for meta-arguments, brigading, and gamification that can keep actual useful information from ever seeing the light of day. A study by Spanish fact-checking site Maldita found that just 8.3% of proposed notes on X actually get published under a post. That’s in part why—along with a premium model that incentivizes clickbait—there is more disinformation and hateful trash on X than there used to be, despite any shame that might be induced by getting Noted.

Maybe Meta will be able to thread the needle and achieve a level of trustworthiness while also successfully scaling community notes to apply to the massive amount of content that gets posted across the company’s platforms every day. Or maybe it’s just a way to turn users into free labor while cutting costs. Who can say for sure? Maybe if we all vote on it, we’ll get to the truth.",0.9879,0.02,0.891,0.089

Contributors must be more than 18 years old and should include a supporting link to post notes, Meta said, touting the system as ""less biased"" than the third-party fact-checking program.

Once Community Notes go live, third-party fact-check labels will no longer appear in the U.S., Meta said.

The company, which has more than 3 billion users worldwide, partners with nearly 100 certified fact-checking organizations in more than 60 languages, according to its website.",0.2247,0.048,0.908,0.044
"META Platforms, Facebook.","'We want to do it right this time,' Meta says as it starts testing Community Notes",Meta is testing its new Community Notes feature that is said to replace 2016's fact-checking capability on its platform.,https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-starts-testing-community-notes,2025-03-13,"What you need to know

Meta seems to be testing out Community Notes for Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.

With this, it looks to create a more unbiased space for people to share varied perspectives on their platform.

As this feature is still being tested, it won't show up on the apps as yet.

Meta seems to be taking varied perspectives seriously as it announced today (Mar. 13) that it has begun testing out Community Notes, similar to what X does on its platform.

With this feature, users would add more context about a certain topic as contributors on that platform. This will replace the now active third-party fact-checking feature on all of its apps. However, like X, users would first have to sign up to be contributors for this feature. These contributors will be allowed to write and rate notes on content across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.

""Around 200,000 potential contributors in the US have signed up so far across all three apps, and the waitlist remains open for those who wish to take part in the program,"" Meta explained in a press release.

The presser added that it will initially use X's open-source algorithm and build on it for Meta's platforms.

To be a contributor, users need to be over 18, have an account that’s more than 6 months old, and be in good standing, meaning not flagged for misuse. Other than that, the profile should be two-factor authenticated as well.

As users start contributing, Meta says the author's names will remain anonymous to protect their privacy and show up as ""People added a community note"" under the said image/topic. Contributors will be able to submit notes on anything, including stuff posted by Meta, politicians, and other public figures. However, they won't be able to add to advertisements.

As for how it works, once contributors add their viewpoints on a certain topic limited to 500 characters, it won't be published on a post ""unless contributors with a range of viewpoints broadly agree on them.""

""No matter how many contributors agree on a note, it won’t be published unless people who normally disagree decide that it provides helpful context,"" the presser explained. Additionally, when community notes are added to a specific image/topic, it won't flag the post the way that fact-checking would.

Meta adds that these notes will not showcase the opinions of the company but will attempt to create a more unbiased platform for people to voice their opinions.

Lastly, Community Notes will be showcased in six different languages commonly used in the United States. This includes English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French, Portuguese, and other languages will be expanded over time. That said, this feature will first be tested out in the U.S. starting Mar. 18 and then be rolled out to a wider audience.",0.9764,0.014,0.911,0.076

This shift raises a pressing question: Does this new feature pose an existential threat to publishers who rely on search traffic? The reality is that some of them have lost 40-95% of their traffic.

What are Google AI-generated Overviews?

Google’s AI Overview Summaries feature provides concise AI-generated summaries of user reviews for products, services, and businesses directly within search results.

These summaries aim to enhance user experience by offering quick insights without the need to navigate multiple pages.

That is a great goal to improve a user-friendly web. But there are costs. Digital media publishers are the canon fodder.

Why it matters

The open web and social media platforms had an unwritten contact at the start of the social media revolution to give everyone who contributed to their platforms a free voice to reach the world.

The first few years delivered on that promise. Bloggers, content creators, influencers and media publishers were able to reach the 5 billion plus online users and bypass the mass media gatekeepers.

Then the social media platforms and Google became the new gatekeepers. New algorithms were introduced to maximize ad revenue and the result minimized the reach of the contributors who created content for free. Their attention and traffic were sacrificed to the mega platforms. Bloggers, media companies and content providers were the sacrificial lambs.

The new digital gatekeeper: AI

Now there is a new tech that takes the stealing of free content to new levels. Artificial intelligence and chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google’s Genesis.

What we didn’t know back then when we started blogs (that’s me in 2009), as media and news sites, was that we had struck a Faustian bargain (A pact whereby a person trades something of supreme importance, such as content, for some worldly or material benefit). And in a world of the web that means attention, traffic and money,

So what is the impact of Google’s AI Overview summaries?

Google’s AI overviews summarize reviews and information, potentially reducing clicks to original sources.

Publishers, especially those relying on affiliate marketing and ad revenue, could see a decline in traffic.

The balance of power in digital content is shifting further in favor of AI-driven aggregation.

Driving the news

PR spin is a great way to paint an existential crisis as an opportunity. Is faster better? Google seems to think so but at what cost?

Google recently announced AI-powered review summaries that provide quick insights without requiring users to visit publisher websites.

Early tests suggest AI-generated overviews are becoming more prominent in search results.

The feature aligns with Google’s push to improve user experience but raises concerns for content creators and businesses.

By the numbers

The numbers tell a story that reveals publisher sites dependence on search with Google almost holding a monopoly. The reality is that Google is not a publisher’s friend. Any public company (that includes Meta and Google) has a commitment to maximize profit for its shareholders.

The algorithm upgrades started with changes that put advertisements at the top of search results, then we had the addition of snippets that took more traffic away and now we are at AI Overview summaries.

We are now at the sharp end of “Enshittification.” What does that mean?

“First, platforms (Facebook and Google are an example) are good to their users (free attention); then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers (Cheap advertising); finally, they abuse those business customers (increase the ad prices to high levels) to claw back all the value for themselves (Make astronomical profits),”

Over 90% of web traffic starts with a search engine, with Google controlling more than 85% of the market.

Studies show AI-generated answers can reduce click-through rates by up to 30%.

Affiliate review sites and media publishers rely on organic search traffic for 50% or more of their revenue.

Here is what the new algorithm changes including AI Overviews looks like for these 5 publishers. Visibility is down from 40% for Forbes and 95% for the publisher: “Time Stamped.”

What’s next

Google’s algorithm changes in the past have provided traffic whiplash as they experiment with making their product more user friendly (they call it better user experience without any thought to their stakeholders that are providing traffic for free).

Or should we say that it is more about making their search more profitable or money grabbing.

So what is next for publishers and Google?

Publishers may need to adapt by focusing on exclusive content, brand authority, and direct audience engagement.

Legal and regulatory scrutiny over Google’s AI practices could intensify.

AI-generated content may redefine SEO strategies, forcing businesses to rethink content monetization models.

How can publishers adapt and survive?

As Google’s AI Overviews threaten traditional search-driven traffic, publishers need to rethink their content distribution strategies. The open social web movement and protocols like ActivityPub (more on that later) and the Fediverse offer an opportunity to regain control over their audiences. Here’s how:

1. Embrace the open social web for direct audience engagement

The open social web refers to decentralized, federated networks where users and publishers interact without a central platform (like Google or Facebook) dictating content distribution. By shifting focus from search traffic to direct engagement, publishers can:

Build owned communities instead of relying on algorithm-driven discovery.

Use email newsletters, paid subscriptions, and membership models for monetization.

Engage with audiences on federated platforms like Mastodon, Threads (Meta’s future ActivityPub integration), and other decentralized networks.

2. Leverage the ActivityPub Protocol for content distribution

ActivityPub is a decentralized protocol that allows different platforms to communicate and share content in an open, federated manner. Publishers can:

Distribute content beyond Google & social media silos – Articles, blog posts, and reviews can be automatically syndicated across federated platforms.

Increase engagement & direct traffic – Followers on Mastodon, Threads, or PeerTube (decentralized YouTube alternative) can receive and interact with content without needing an algorithmic push.

Bypass centralized content moderation risks – Instead of being at the mercy of Google’s AI, publishers can cultivate loyal audiences through independent, open networks.

Example: The New Yorker or The Verge could publish articles via their own ActivityPub-powered feed, allowing Mastodon users to follow updates natively without needing Google Search or Twitter/X.

3. Own distribution with AI-Optimized content strategies

Since AI-generated summaries will continue to take up search real estate, publishers should:

Create content AI can’t easily summarize (e.g., exclusive interviews, deep analysis, expert commentary).

Use structured data (schema markup) to optimize for AI consumption while ensuring citations drive traffic back to their sites.

Develop interactive experiences (such as quizzes, calculators, and AI tools) that users must visit the site to use.

4. Monetization beyond ads: Subscription, NFTs & decentralized revenue

As traffic from Google declines, publishers must diversify revenue: Here are three ideas.

Subscription & Memberships – Direct monetization via newsletters, Patreon, or Substack. Tokenized Access & NFTs – Web3-enabled access to premium content. Decentralized Micropayments – Using protocols like Lightning Network (Bitcoin) or Web Monetization API to receive payments for content views.

5. Future-proof with AI & first-party data

Since AI is here to stay, publishers should:

Deploy AI Assistants – Custom AI chatbots that summarize articles on their own websites, keeping users engaged.

Leverage First-Party Data – Encourage users to create accounts, allowing personalized content delivery without reliance on Google’s search algorithm.

SEO for AI Search – Optimize for Google’s AI answers by becoming a trusted source Google cites (instead of being ignored).

The shift is happening. Those who adapt will thrive, while those who remain dependent on Google risk fading into obscurity.

But the reality is that it is not easy.

Final thoughts

Google’s AI Overviews feature represents a fundamental shift in the search ecosystem. Publishers who fail to adapt risk obsolescence, while those who innovate could find new ways to thrive in an AI-driven content landscape. And we are all scrambling to find new ways to play the digital publishing game and monetize.

Google’s Overviews may seem like an existential threat, but it also highlights the need for publishers to take back control. By adopting the open social web, leveraging ActivityPub, and diversifying revenue streams, publishers can future-proof their businesses in an AI-driven world. But it is not without complexity and cost. Easy to say but hard to do.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Taxing Social Media Ads Might Help Us Get Our Attention Back,Two MIT economists argue that a tax on digital advertising revenues could limit social media companies incentives to addict us to scrolling.,https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/patient-revolution/202503/taxing-social-media-ads-might-help-us-get-our-attention-back,2025-03-12,"Forget oil or data. Could attention actually be the most valuable commodity in modern life?

That question underlies MSNBC host Chris Hayes’ new book The Sirens' Call: How Attention Became the World’s Most Endangered Resource. And it’s one you ought to remember the next time you feel your phone buzz in your pocket.

“Attention is the stuff of consciousness itself, where we choose to place our mind’s focus at any given moment,” Hayes writes. “And yet it can always be wrenched from us seemingly against our will by the wail of the siren, the bark of a dog, or the flash of a prurient image on our phone.”

He is among a rising number of observers who have become alarmed by the addictive “attention-fracking” tactics that social-media companies use to keep us glued to our phones—particularly how we seem to pick them up every minute because we’re hooked on the slow drip of every Instagram like, email, and text message. The companies have grown rich by surveilling the massive amounts of behavioral data to be mined in our every digital footstep.

Two Nobel Prize-winning economists recently presented a proposal that directly confronts the growing issue of fractured public attention, suggesting a potentially transformative solution.

Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson, longtime collaborators at MIT, floated their idea in a 2024 article in Network Law Review, arguing for a 50% tax on digital advertising revenues for companies generating $500 million or more annually. The concept is modeled on highly successful taxes on cigarettes, introduced in the mid-20th century, which were one of a number of factors that led to curbing US smoking.



They argue that breaking up Big Tech, while a popular applause line for politicians, would do nothing to remove the underlying economic and psychological tactics companies use to hook users. But a well-designed tax might prevent companies from profiting from incendiary speech and algorithmic echo chambers.



Taxing advertising revenues in this way would remove the built-in incentive to keep us scrolling: The more time we spend addicted to cheap dopamine hits through an app, the more money the company makes from the ads we see. If that model became less profitable, it would motivate Meta (the parent company for Facebook and Instagram) or Alphabet (which has Google and YouTube in its portfolio) to move toward subscription business models.

If consumers paid for a subscription forsuch a service, there would be a greater likelihood that the overall social network's algorithm would reward paying users by serving up more more thoughtful or meaningful posts. At the same time, the economic incentives would reward innovation and make it more possible for other newer or smaller companies to compete.

“We urgently need more pro-human AI ideas and products to come to market,” Acemoglu and Johnson wrote. “A major step in the right direction would involve imposing a high tax on digital ad revenues, with the explicit and transparent goal of strongly discouraging the current, massively damaging business model of ‘attention above all’ and ‘boundless data collection.’”

Cracking down on Big Tech has significant bipartisan support. When it comes to protecting children online, Congress has demonstrated willingness to act. In some cases, tech companies themselves have requested regulation. As support grew for the 2024 Kids Online Safety Act, Meta funded billboards at Washington, DC bus stops welcoming regulation of Instagram.

The data was clearly there. Mental health issues among teens have surged over the past decade, correlated with the now-ubiquitous presence of phones in their lives. Teens are spending up to 5 hours every day on social media, according to the American Psychological Association. That vast majority of that time is focused on three platforms: YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.

There might be political capital for more action. On the right, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) has pursued tech monopolies since the day he was elected. He’s called for banning addictive features like infinite scroll and autoplay, creating a minimum age to be allowed on social media, and allowing parents to sue social-media companies for compensation for harm and abuse their children experience online.

On the left, Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-MA), a millennial graduate of Harvard and MIT, brings the tech cred that’s lacking in so many septuagenarian politicians. When he isn’t wrangling votes, the 37-year-old father of three is chasing after his own kids and plotting how to carve out family time from screen time.

Auchincloss proposes a value-added tax, or VAT, that would be levied on social-media companies, based on the amount of time a user spends scrolling. In essence, if we are “paying” attention, then the companies are taxed for “buying” it. Revenues from the proposed tax could then be stored separately from the government’s general fund. The revenues could be channeled to revitalize local journalism outlets.

Redirecting those funds toward journalism would shore up a sector that is vital to democratic societies, but whose business model has been superseded by technology. It would help underwrite overwhelmed fact-checking operations that Meta stopped funding in January. And it would go a long way toward reinvigorating our shared information space that has been fragmented into a million pieces.

It would empower social-media companies to live up to the idealistic promises they made back when Mark Zuckerberg was still living in a dorm at Harvard.



Ultimately, a tax on social-media companies gets to the heart of what makes a nation prosperous or a failed state, as explored by the same MIT economists who proposed the social media attention tax. In their book, Why Nations Fail, Acemoglu and Johnson argue that nations with extractive institutions can succeed in the short term. But in the long run, they’re stymied.

If we can begin to see our own attention as a resource like oil or minerals, that could open up an era of liberation.",0.9978,0.042,0.836,0.122

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Facebook discloses FreeType 2 flaw exploited in attacks,"Facebook is warning that a FreeType vulnerability in all versions up to 2.13 can lead to arbitrary code execution, with reports that the flaw has been exploited in attacks. [...]",https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/facebook-discloses-freetype-2-flaw-exploited-in-attacks/,2025-03-12,"Facebook is warning that a FreeType vulnerability in all versions up to 2.13 can lead to arbitrary code execution, with reports that the flaw has been exploited in attacks.

FreeType is a popular open-source font rendering library used to display text and programmatically add text to images. It provides functionality to load, rasterize, and render fonts in various formats, such as TrueType (TTF), OpenType (OTF), and others.

The library is installed in millions of systems and services, including Linux, Android, game engines, GUI frameworks, and online platforms.

The vulnerability, tracked under CVE-2025-27363 and given a CVSS v3 severity score of 8.1 (""high""), was fixed in FreeType version 2.13.0 on February 9th, 2023.

Facebook disclosed the flaw yesterday, warning that the vulnerability is exploitable in all versions of FreeType up to version 2.13 and that there are reports of it actively being exploited in attacks.

""An out of bounds write exists in FreeType versions 2.13.0 and below when attempting to parse font subglyph structures related to TrueType GX and variable font files,"" reads the bulletin.

""The vulnerable code assigns a signed short value to an unsigned long and then adds a static value causing it to wrap around and allocate too small of a heap buffer.""

""The code then writes up to 6 signed long integers out of bounds relative to this buffer. This may result in arbitrary code execution.""

Facebook may rely on FreeType in some capacity, but it is unclear if the attacks seen by its security team took place on its platform or if they discovered them elsewhere.

Considering the widespread use of FreeType across multiple platforms, software developers and project administrators must upgrade to FreeType 2.13.3 (latest version) as soon as possible.

Although the latest vulnerable version (2.13.0) dates two years, older library versions can persist in software projects for extended periods, making it important to address the flaw as soon as possible.

BleepingComputer asked Meta about the flaw and how it was exploited, and was sent the following statement.

""We report security bugs in open source software when we find them because it strengthens online security for everyone,"" Facebook told BleepingComputer.

""We think users expect us to keep working on ways to improve security. We remain vigilant and committed to protecting people's private communications.""",0.8225,0.07,0.849,0.081
"META Platforms, Facebook.",Judge says Meta must defend claim it stripped copyright info from Llama's training fodder,"Facebook giant allegedly didn't want neural networks to emit results that would give the game away
A judge has found Meta must answer a claim it allegedly removed so-called copyright management information from material used to train its AI models.…",https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/11/meta_dmca_copyright_removal_case/,2025-03-11,"A judge has found Meta must answer a claim it allegedly removed so-called copyright management information from material used to train its AI models.

The Friday ruling by Judge Vince Chhabria concerned the case Kadrey et al vs Meta Platforms, filed in July 2023 in a San Francisco federal court as a proposed class action by authors Richard Kadrey, Sarah Silverman, and Christopher Golden, who reckon the Instagram titan's use of their work to train its neural networks was illegal.

Their case burbled along until January 2025 when the plaintiffs made the explosive allegation that Meta knew it used copyrighted material for training, and that its AI models would therefore produce results that included copyright management information (CMI) – the fancy term for things like the creator of a copyrighted work, its license and terms of use, its date of creation, and so on, that accompany copyrighted material.

The miffed scribes alleged Meta therefore removed all of this copyright info from the works it used to train its models so users wouldn’t be made aware the results they saw stemmed from copyrighted stuff.

Judge Chhabria last week allowed the plaintiff’s claim that Meta violated the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by removing copyright notices from works used to train the Facebook giant's Llama family of models to continue. That decision makes it more likely the case will end in settlement or trial.

""[The plaintiffs'] allegations raise a 'reasonable, if not particularly strong, inference' that Meta removed CMI to try to prevent Llama from outputting CMI and thus revealing that it was trained on copyrighted material,"" Judge Chhabria wrote in his order [PDF]. ""This use of copyrighted material is clearly an identifiable (alleged) infringement.""

Meta has already admitted [PDF] it used a dataset named Books3 to train its Llama 1 large language model. The dataset has been found to include copyrighted works.

The news isn’t all bad for Meta because Judge Chhabria tossed one of the plaintiffs' claims – that Meta's Llama use of unlicensed books obtained from peer-to-peer torrents violated California's Comprehensive Computer Data Access & Fraud Act (CDAFA).

Edward Lee, a professor of law at Santa Clara University, told The Register we should not infer anything about fair use based on the author's DMCA 1202(b)(1) claim about the scrubbed CMI.

""At the hearing, Judge Chhabria also expressed some skepticism the plaintiffs would prove the DMCA [claim] and said it could be revisited on summary judgment,"" Lee said. ""What it does show is that the plaintiffs' attorneys were able to find a more particularized factual basis for their DMCA claim, which had been dismissed earlier in the case.""

By allowing the CMI claim to advance, Chabria has delivered a second ruling that suggests the indiscriminate ingestion of copyrighted material to train AI models may have financial consequences.

The first came last month when Thomson Reuters won a partial summary judgment against shuttered AI firm Ross Intelligence that prevents the defendant firm from avoiding liability by claiming fair use.

Legal scholars have argued that AI inference – apps that produce outputs based on AI models – is more likely to be deemed copyright infringement because it's obvious when a model spits out an author's work verbatim. Inputting copyrighted material into models for training has been viewed as more likely to qualify for fair use defenses.

However, the Thomson Reuters decision and the survival of the DMCA claim against Meta look likely to strengthen plaintiffs in other AI-related litigation.

For example, Tremblay et al vs OpenAI et al was amended [PDF] last week. It seeks to revive its previously dismissed DMCA claim based on new but redacted evidence supporting allegations of CMI removal.

Citing revelations that followed from discovery, the revised complaint argues, ""As amended, the DMCA claim sufficiently alleges that OpenAI actually removed CMI for training its large language models.""

Bluesky's CEO took the stage at SXSW this week, but her message wasn't just in what she said. It was also in what she wore.

Jay Graber wore a black T-shirt that read ""Mundus sine caesaribus,"" which is Latin for ""a world without Caesars."" The statement piece is seemingly a dig at Mark Zuckerberg.

The Meta CEO has taken to wearing T-shirts with Latin or Greek phrases on them in recent years amid his broader style evolution.

At his 40th birthday party last year, he wore a shirt saying ""Carthago delenda est,"" which means ""Carthage must be destroyed."" The phrase, attributed to Roman historian Cato the Elder, was a rallying cry for Facebook in 2016 in its competition with Google.

At a live taping of the ""Acquired"" podcast in September, he donned a shirt he designed that said ""learning through suffering"" in Greek.

And Zuckerberg compared himself to the Roman dictator Julius Caesar with a shirt he wore at Meta's Connect developer conference last year. It read ""Aut Zuck aut nihil,"" a riff on the phrase ""Aut Caesar aut nihil,"" which translates to ""Either Caesar or nothing.""

Graber's shirt appears to send a message on how she feels about Zuck's antics.

Bluesky is an open-source alternative to social platforms like Meta's Facebook and Threads and Elon Musk's X, which is formerly known as Twitter.

Since Trump was elected as president, Meta has made some significant changes to its platform, including replacing third-party fact-checking with community notes.

Following the election, Bluesky also saw a surge in new users.

Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter and Bluesky, said in a recent episode of the ""In Good Company"" podcast that he thinks ""people are running away from X, rather than running to something on Bluesky.""

Bluesky was created in 2019 as an internal project at Twitter, where Dorsey was still CEO. Two years later, it launched as a stand-alone public benefit corporation.

Its platform officially launched in February 2024 with around 3 million users and grew to 25.9 million users by the end of the year.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Shopping app LTK beefs up consumer app with focus on videos as social algorithms keep changing,"With more creators becoming influential omnichannel merchants and attracting brands for sponsored content and product collaborations, LTK (LiketoKnow.it) saw an opportunity to relaunch the app starting in late February with an emphasis on video content. The a…",http://digiday.com/marketing/shopping-app-ltk-beefs-up-consumer-app-with-focus-on-videos-as-social-algorithms-keep-changing/,2025-03-11,"With so many creators making their livelihoods across social platforms, players like shopping app LTK and creators virtually have no control over how those algorithms shift and prioritize content.

More importantly, this leaves creators vulnerable if their affiliate businesses are built on social media, like TikTok and Instagram. LTK hopes to give back control to creators with a revamp of its consumer app that began in late February.

LTK (LiketoKnow.it) might be best known for finding deals and trendy influencers, but the company is now overhauling its consumer experience to focus on more entertainment and social media features, like direct messages, discovery feed and videos. The new app will look and feel more like a social app with a watch video tab based on location and interests, a home feed of updates from creators, chat tab for messaging and a discover page for finding more related content.

LTK did not provide new updates from its launch, including how many creators have posted video content and the daily users on the app.

“Because traditional social media platforms have shifted from a place to see people you follow to algorithm-driven, interest-based feeds, there’s a lane open to create this type of experience,” said Dina Murphy, product director of LTK.

It’s also about attracting more ad dollars: If creators are able to grow their social content on LTK, the app can use it to attract more advertisers — especially those eager to reach its some 40 million monthly users (with 38% being Gen Z and millennial women in the U.S.), according to LTK at the ANA Creator Marketing Conference this January. In a session on social commerce, the company also noted a high “saturation” of users with an income of $100,000 or more.

Despite a difficult economic time, some people will still shop for non-essentials from DTC brands and other luxury goods. This February, high average order value brands ($250+) in apparel, shoes and accessories were up 7% year-over-year, and high-ticket home brands ($500+) saw double-digit growth (while lower-ticket brands lagged behind), according to figures provided by Belardi Wong, an agency working with high-end fashion and retail brands.

Yet Murphy pointed to a bigger problem of decline in creator content visibility on major platforms, marked by LTK creators seeing average social impressions per post on their Meta apps drop significantly since last year, according to LTK’s internal data. (Murphy declined to share specific figures.) This could result in creator content not being seen if other content is prioritized higher in users’ feeds, Murphy explained.

“It’s a huge, huge problem and then of course, has downstream funnel impacts, which is if creators are or consumers are not seeing that post — then they’re not shopping for it and they’re not buying it,” Murphy told Digiday.

If anything, revamping LTK to get more creators making videos also comes amid ongoing uncertainty in the short-form video space. TikTok’s questionable long-term status in the U.S. has pushed many creators to diversify their content and revenue streams across multiple platforms beyond social media, from Substack newsletters to Tumblr blogs – but whether LTK and other commerce platforms can gain from this remains to be seen.

Some 250,000 creators are on LTK, and 38% of all Gen Z and millennial and 21% of all adult women (18+) are LTK users, based on U.S. population data, according to Murphy. Its consumer app, which first launched in 2017, isn’t trying to compete with social giants like TikTok or Instagram, though.

“Our purpose and business models are different [from social platforms],” Murphy said. “Just as you see LinkedIn as a place for professionals existing alongside traditional social media platforms – LTK is the place to catch up with creators you follow and control your feed to discover creators relevant to you.”

So far, between LTK and shopping and affiliate app ShopMy, Lindsay Nead, CEO of talent agency Parker Management, sees about a 50/50 split of creators using the two. However, Nead said there has been some uptick of creators moving over to ShopMy for better commission and certain backend features that are more user-friendly, she explained. ShopMy has a network of some 70,000 creators, who can create storefronts and link their socials and newsletters, but it is more of an influencer marketing platform that streamlines the talent discovery and campaign management.

“Historically, most creators have all been using LTK,” Nead said. “But over the last year, ShopMy has been taking more and more creators. I think everybody will still keep LTK – obviously they have both, but we’re just seeing more and more creators use ShopMy more frequently for [slightly more lucrative commission structures].”

ShopMy offers creators commission rates for affiliates ranging from 10% to 30%, per the company. The LTK average commission rate is between 10% to 25%, but can reach up to 30% as well, according to the company. In both cases, retailers set their own commission rates for products, so the exact rates can vary depending on brand. LTK is not changing commission rates with this app update.

Another incentive for creators to use LTK: Creators using it frequently and successfully also get more brand partnerships “within their ecosystem” of brands that LTK works with, such as Walmart and Nordstrom, Nead added. ShopMy also has similar incentives to brands using the platform, from Chanel to Nike, to allow campaign proposals directly from creators, as well as paid partnership and negotiation tools for all parties. ShopMy also provides agency services from its in-house team, from focusing on creator partnerships to affiliate programs.

“[LTK will] include you in more of those partnerships if you’re using the app and successful using it,” Nead said.

For example, LTK creators that organically discovered and started promoting the viral Stanley Cups led to a spike in traffic to the product. LTK is also partnering with NFL wives and girlfriends to promote team gear and drive more brand awareness and sales, as well as partnering with Olympians and Bloomingdale’s to find more brand opportunities during major events. In a LTK case study, a U.K.-based style creator grew her income from 1,000 euros to 128,000 euros per year — after repurposing her social media content, going to events with creators and pivoting to product reviews as opposed to collages.

Another change to LTK is no longer requiring creators to tag products since last year. This is another way the app hopes to encourage more types of video content posted by creators, Murphy explained.

“We’re talking to creators about [giving] us all of your rich, awesome content that you have for storytelling, and then what this watch tab is meant to do is really help you connect to the right consumers,” Murphy added.

For its part, LTK aims to appeal to creators by providing a social media experience that people were used to in the early days of Facebook or Instagram – one where they follow people and see their updates based on recency – at a time when major social platforms are moving away from that personal feed to prioritize trending content. (Although, there is now an option to flip back to chronological browsing on Instagram, for example.) LTK is also introducing new video editing tools on the creator app to make it easier to produce content.

“The community that I had and created and nurtured as a creator for over 10-plus years is no longer seeing my content, and I need a place to do that,” Murphy said.

Increasingly, Nead’s agency advises creators to pick at least two channels that they own, whether it’s a personal website or a newsletter list. If they are using LTK and other shopping apps, content is usually repurposed, but with these new features she could see incentive to make content for LTK that is more focused on entertaining videos, like outfit ideas or other ways to use products.

“I definitely feel like people want deals [on LTK], but some more like fashion style creators, they do date night looks [and show] five back-to-back outfits of date night looks,” Nead said. “I think that’s a really intriguing way for their audiences to shop, so that’s where that video content is really, really helpful. It’s more almost informative video content versus, like, entertaining content.”",0.9995,0.018,0.851,0.131

The post 3 Ways AI Is Changing PPC Reporting (With Examples To Streamline Your Reporting) appeared first on Search Engine Journal.",https://www.searchenginejournal.com/ways-ai-is-changing-ppc-reporting/539444/,2025-03-10,"PPC reporting has always been both essential and frustrating. It’s essential to keep clients engaged by informing them of the results you’re driving.

But it’s also frustrating because of data discrepancies, cumbersome analysis, and the time required to share understandable, jargon-free reports with different stakeholders.

Fortunately, AI is turning these obstacles into opportunities by filling in gaps left by privacy-compliant tracking, surfacing insights hidden in overwhelming data sets, and automating reporting so it meets the needs of every stakeholder.

In this article, I’ll walk you through some of the technology used by modern marketers and share examples of how I’ve used AI to streamline my PPC reporting.

1. Collect Complete And High-Quality PPC Data

We need data to guide us before we can optimize accounts and share our wins, so let’s start there.

The Problems With Data Before AI

Inconsistent and missing data plague PPC efforts.

Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon operate in their own silos, each taking credit for all conversions that have any touchpoint with their platforms. This leads to double counting, making it difficult to decide where to allocate budgets for optimal results.

In other words, the data between the various ad platforms is inconsistent. Specifically, the conversion value advertisers see in their business data may be lower than the sum of all conversion values reported by the ad platforms.

Add to this the challenge of missing data. Privacy regulations like GDPR and Apple’s iOS changes limit tracking capabilities, which causes data loss, incomplete conversion paths, and gaps in attribution.

Marketers who rely heavily on pixel-based or third-party cookie tracking, both of which became unreliable due to browser restrictions and user opt-outs, see a continuous decline in the quality of the data they need to operate.

While AI can’t magically give us perfect data, it can fill in gaps and restore insights, so let’s take a look at some of the solutions in this space.

AI-Driven Solutions For Data Hygiene And Compliance

1. Data Clean Rooms And Privacy-First Measurement

Clean rooms like Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC) and Google Ads Data Hub allow advertisers to securely analyze anonymized cross-channel performance data without violating privacy laws.

These platforms aggregate data from multiple sources, giving marketers a comprehensive view of the customer journey.

Example:

A retail brand can use AMC to evaluate how its Google and Facebook ads influence Amazon purchases. Based on what they find, they can re-allocate budgets between platforms to maximize overall return on investment (ROI).

Clean rooms themselves aren’t an AI innovation; however, they benefit significantly from several AI capabilities.

For example, Meta’s Advantage+ uses clean room insights to build lookalike audiences while staying privacy-compliant.

2. Modeled Conversions

While clean rooms are great for unifying cross-platform data, their usefulness is predicated on data completeness.

When privacy regulations make it impossible to get all the data, clean rooms like Google Ads Data Hub and Amazon Marketing Cloud use AI-powered modeled conversions to estimate user journeys that can’t be fully tracked.

Modeled data is also used by tools like Smart Bidding, which leverages machine learning to predict conversions for users who opted out of tracking.

For users who opt out of tracking, Consent Mode still allows the collection of anonymized signals, which machine learning models can then use to predict conversion likelihood.

Example:

Google’s Smart Bidding leverages machine learning to optimize bids for conversions or conversion value.

In cases where conversion data is incomplete due to user consent choices or other factors, Smart Bidding can use modeled conversions to fill in gaps and make good bidding decisions.

The models do this by identifying patterns and correlations between user attributes, actions, and conversion outcomes.

While modeled conversions offer significant benefits in their ease of use (they’re basically provided without any extra effort by the ad platforms), it’s important to remember that they are only estimates and may not be perfectly accurate in all cases.

Advertisers should consider using modeled conversions in conjunction with other ways to get a more complete picture of campaign performance.

For example, advertisers can use Media Mix Models (MMM), a Marketing Efficiency Ratio (MER), or incrementality lift tests to validate that the data they are using is directionally correct.

3. Server-Side Tagging And First-Party Data Integration

Server-side tagging lets marketers control data collection on their servers, bypassing cookie restrictions.

Platforms like Google Tag Manager now support server-side implementations that improve tracking accuracy while maintaining privacy compliance.

Server-side tagging captures anonymous pings even when cookies are declined, feeding better signals into Google’s AI models for more accurate conversion modeling.

This gives AI more complete data when doing things like data-driven attribution (DDA) or automated bidding.

Example:

An ecommerce company transitions to server-side tagging to retain high-quality data even when technologies like Safari’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) break JavaScript-based tracking.

As a result, the advertiser sees a complete picture of all the conversions driven by digital marketing and can now justify higher bids, which makes them more competitive in the ad auction and boosts total sales for their brand.

Actionable Tips:

Implement GA4 Consent Mode and server-side tagging to maintain accurate performance data.

Leverage data clean rooms to analyze cross-platform conversions securely.

Use modeled conversions to fill tracking gaps caused by privacy restrictions.

2. Extract Data Insights And Make Smarter Decisions

Now that we’ve covered technologies that can stem the decline in access to data, let’s examine how AI can help make sense of it all.

The Problem With Data Analysis Before AI

Marketers may struggle to extract actionable insights when looking at a mountain of PPC data.

Humans simply aren’t as good as machines at detecting patterns or spotting anomalies in large data sets.

While statistical methods have long been used to find these patterns, many marketing teams lack the expertise to do it themselves or have no access to a qualified analyst to help them.

As a result, teams miss opportunities or spend more time than they can afford looking for signals to guide optimization efforts.

AI Solutions For Data Analysis And Attribution

1. Data-Driven Attribution Models (DDA)

DDA isn’t the newest solution in attribution modeling, but it exists largely because AI has become cheaper and more accessible.

It solves the problem of assigning values to different parts of the consumer journey when users take a multitude of paths from discovery to purchase.

Static attribution models lack the sophistication to account for this and cause advertisers to bid incorrectly.

Google’s data-driven attribution (DDA) uses machine learning to analyze conversion paths and assign credit based on a more complete analysis of a user’s consumer journey.

Unlike static models, DDA dynamically adjusts credit allocation to reflect the many ways consumers behave.

Machine learning, a form of AI, is what enabled Google to make this more advanced attribution model available to all advertisers and what has driven the steady improvement in results from Smart Bidding.

2. Automating Auction Insights Visualization

Generative AI is not only enhancing attribution but also automating repetitive tasks.

Recently, I tested GPT Operator to streamline several PPC reporting workflows.

Operator is OpenAI’s tool that lets the AI use a web browser to achieve tasks. It goes beyond searching on the web; it allows you to follow links, fill in forms, and interact intelligently with websites.

In one task, I asked Operator to download auction insights, visualize the data using Optmyzr’s Auction Insights Visualizer, and email a report.

It handled the data transfer and visualization steps flawlessly, though it struggled with taking a clean screenshot instead of attempting to attach HTML.

This illustrates how AI agents can help when data lives in disparate places. There are no APIs available to move it, as is the case with auction insights data from Google.

While Operator still needs too much hand-holding to be helpful today, it seems likely that we’re less than a year away from when it can do many tedious tasks for us.

3. Advanced Statistical Analysis Available To Anyone

Before AI advancements, conducting a statistical analysis could be a labor-intensive process requiring specialized software or data science expertise.

But today, generative AI enables marketers to explore these areas that were previously firmly outside their realm of expertise.

For example, GPT can explain and execute a process like a seasonality decomposition. AI can quickly write Python code that breaks down campaign data into trend, seasonal, and residual components, helping marketers uncover patterns they can act on.

How AI Automates Seasonal Analysis

In one of my PPC Town Hall podcast episodes, Cory Lindholm demonstrated how GPT can handle complex seasonality analysis in minutes.

Inspired by this, I used GPT’s Advanced Data Analysis feature to upload weekly Google Ads data and run a full decomposition.

GPT efficiently cleaned the data, identified issues like formatting errors, and generated a breakdown of trends, seasonal variations, and residual fluctuations.

In the analysis, GPT flagged recurring trends, allowing me to pinpoint peak demand periods and optimize bid strategies ahead of time. Tasks that previously took hours now take just a few minutes.

On a side note, I have found large language models (LLMs) so helpful with coding that I am now using v0.dev almost weekly to create apps, browser extensions, and scripts on a weekly basis.

3. Communicate Results Effectively Across Teams

With solid data in place and AI-fueled ways to speed up analysis, we should have some great results to share with stakeholders.

But sharing results through reports has traditionally been one of the most time-consuming and least loved tasks that fall on the plate of the typical account manager. And there were other problems, too.

The Problem With Sharing Reports Before AI

Reports were often static, one-size-fits-all documents that failed to meet the needs of different stakeholders.

Executives required high-level summaries focused on ROI, marketing strategists needed cross-channel insights, and PPC specialists required detailed campaign data.

Customizing reports for each audience was time-consuming and prone to error.

AI Solutions For Tailored Reporting

1. LLM Report Summarization

LLMs such as Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT can quickly generate different explanations of reports from the same underlying data, enabling efficient customization for each audience.

For example, ChatGPT can produce a concise executive summary alongside a more detailed keyword-level report for PPC teams.

But that customization can and should be taken even further. In OpenAI, it’s possible to create custom GPTs, each with its own instructions. This can be used to create a different ChatGPT flavor for every client.

Whereas today, agencies depend on their people to remember how each client likes to get their reports, GPT can be trained to remember these preferences.

Things like how well they know PPC, what jargon they tend to use at their company, and even what the year’s strategic initiatives are.

Then, the LLM can word the summary in a way that resonates with the reader and even explain how the search marketing campaign’s results are key to the company’s strategic objectives for the year.

2. Interactive Dashboards For Real-Time Transparency

AI-driven dashboards provide live, customizable views of campaign performance. Stakeholders can explore data interactively, filtering by date ranges, platforms, or key performance indicators (KPIs), reducing the need for frequent manual report updates.

And while dashboards have been around for a long time, AI can be used to quickly highlight the most salient insights.

For example, AMC lets marketers use AI to generate SQL to explore the data by using natural language.

At my company, Optmyzr, we deployed Sidekick, which can instantly answer questions about data in any account, for example, the biggest optimization opportunities or wins in the last month.

Before AI, these insights might have remained hidden in the data.

Actionable Tips:

Set up custom GPTs for every client you work with.

Implement reporting tools that use natural language to explore the data.

Conclusion: From Reporting To Strategic Decision-Making With Generative AI

Generative AI has redefined PPC reporting, transforming a once fragmented and time-consuming process into a streamlined, insight-driven workflow.

It doesn’t just automate data collection and report generation; it also surfaces hidden trends, correlations, and anomalies that might otherwise go unnoticed.

This enables marketers to make smarter, faster, and more strategic decisions based on real-time insights.

With AI-driven tools, marketers can see beyond surface-level metrics, discovering patterns and opportunities that traditional reporting might take hours or days to uncover.

This improved understanding of performance empowers teams to refine budget allocation, creative strategy, and campaign targeting more effectively, leading to more substantial outcomes and greater profitability.

The conclusion is simple. With Generative AI, PPC managers have more complete data, leading to better insights and better decisions – all of which can be shared more meaningfully with all involved stakeholders.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Facebook to verify identities of all advertisers amid rise in scams,"The assessment period for Carousell's pilot has been extended for another six months, until Jun 30.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/meta-facebook-advertisements-verify-identities-advertisers-rise-scams-mha-carousell-ocha-4989486,2025-03-10,"SINGAPORE: Meta plans to verify the identities of all advertisers on Facebook against government-issued records by the end of June, as part of requirements under the Online Criminal Harms Act (OCHA).

This comes after the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) noted a 12 per cent increase in the number of scams from Facebook advertisements between June and December 2024.

During this six-month period, MHA allowed Meta to apply the verification measures to the identities of selected advertisers. If the number of scams did not drop significantly, the ministry would tighten its requirements.

Given that Meta was unable to curb the number of scam advertisements, it would be required to roll out verification measures in the coming months.

""MHA notes that Meta intends to verify the identities of all advertisers on Facebook by end-June 2025. We welcome this and will monitor the situation,"" the ministry said in a media release on Monday (Mar 10).

With the new measures, advertisers will have to verify and disclose the beneficiary and the payer of ads targeting Singapore before running a new ad campaign, Rafael Frankel, Meta's director of public policy in Southeast Asia, said in response to CNA's queries.

""Information about the verified beneficiary and payer will be included on the ad infosheet and in the publicly accessible Ad Library,"" Dr Frankel said.

Businesses that have already verified themselves with Facebook will not be required to re-verify.

Dr Frankel noted Meta's announcement last October that it would begin testing facial recognition technology as a means to tackle ""celeb-bait"" ads. This will extend to Singapore, he said.

""We’re also testing this technology as a means for people to verify their identity and regain access to compromised accounts - a frequent vector for scams.""

Under a new code of practice for e-commerce services, which came into effect in June last year, Meta and Carousell were required to introduce measures to protect users from scams.

They operate platforms that are deemed at the highest risk of e-commerce scams.

In 2024, Facebook made up 37.4 per cent of all e-commerce scams with 4,368 reported cases, while Carousell represented 17 per cent with 1,987 cases.

FACEBOOK PAGES

Apart from Facebook advertisements, MHA said it had observed ""a significant proportion"" of e-commerce scams being perpetrated on Facebook Pages. Scammers would create pages under the pretext of advertising the sale of goods and services in order to reach out to their victims.

""MHA is working with Meta to introduce the enhanced verification requirement for Facebook Pages in 2025,"" it said.

Meta will be allowed to apply the verification requirements only to selected pages for a start.

Similar to its approach to the other Facebook services, the effectiveness of the measures for Facebook Pages will be assessed for a period of time.

""If the scam numbers do not decrease significantly, we may require stronger measures to be implemented, such as requiring Facebook to apply verification requirements to all pages,"" MHA said.

""We plan to begin testing enhanced verification measures for Facebook Pages in Singapore this year,"" Dr Frankel told CNA.",-0.9747,0.081,0.866,0.052
"META Platforms, Facebook.",Meta’s censored “Facebook for China” sounds like a privacy nightmare,"In 2014, Meta was reportedly working on a “Facebook for China” that would be heavily censored and give user data access to the Chinese government.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/meta-china-facebook-project-aldrin-censorship-government-data-access-report/,2025-03-10,"The Chinese internet and social media ecosystem is a heavily censored pool, one that aggressively bans and removes any content that is deemed unaligned to the government policies. One of the reasons why Western social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram could never make an inroad in the market is due to that extensive censorship and local data regulation laws.

Meta, however, was reportedly eager to enter the Chinese market and with such eagerness that it was willing to share user data with the Chinese government and create a complex censorship filter, as well. The revelations come as part of a complaint filed by a Meta whistleblower, which contained internal documents and communication viewed by The Washington Post.

Filed before the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by former Director of Public Policy at Facebook, Sarah Wynn-Williams, the 78-page complaint that the social media juggernaut created a China-favoring censorship system in China in hopes of launching Facebook in the country.

What was Project Aldrin?

According to The Post, the Mark Zuckerberg-led company also “planned to install a “chief editor” who would decide what content to remove and could shut down the entire site” during times of social unrest. The company is claimed to have created a dedicated team for its planned China operations as part of an internal project codenamed “Aldrin.”

But more than just creating a censorship system, Meta also was reportedly willing to stifle dissent against the government. “Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg also agreed to crack down on the account of a high-profile Chinese dissident living in the United States following pressure from a high-ranking Chinese official the company hoped would help them enter China,” says the report citing the complaint.

Furthermore, the company was even willing to loosen its privacy rules and grant the Chinese government access to data covering China as well as Hong Kong-based users. The plans kicked into motion in 2014, but were ultimately abandoned in 2019 when diplomatic relations between the US and China were strained.

Meta won’t be the only player with such ambitions. Back in 2018, Google was reportedly working on a heavily censored version of Search under the codename “Project Dragonfly,” but the plans were ultimately put on cold ice. As of 2025, AI is the new tech hunting ground, and the spectre of Chinese censorship is clearly visible on products such as the DeepSeek open-source AI model

He was also the subject of a widely praised 2010 film directed by David Fincher about Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook as a Harvard undergraduate during the early 2000s, and the inner workings of his social media properties have been the subject of intense political scrutiny for more than a decade.

Facebook and Instagram's importance in the media ecosystem has made the decision-making inside Zuckerberg's organizations an issue of intense public debate.

How he amassed his fortune

The story of Facebook's origins at elite Harvard University is well-known. Zuckerberg, who hails from Dobbs Ferry, New York, in suburban Westchester County, had already built sophisticated software before he got to the Ivy League. When he was ""somewhere around 10 or 12 years old,"" Zuckerberg ""built a chat service for his family — and for his dad’s dental business"" that he called ""ZuckNet,"" said Vox . In high school, he created a program called Synapse, ""that would keep track of every song the user played on a computer"" and after determining the user's preferences ""would begin to make playlists"" of recommended music,"" said The Harvard Crimson . Spotify would later turn that basic model into a multi-billion dollar business empire.

At Harvard, Zuckerberg created Facemash, a ""hot or not clone"" which ""had already made Mark a bit of a celebrity on campus,"" said Business Insider. The site pulled student photos from Harvard's website and allowed users to pick which person was better looking, and Zuckerberg was nearly expelled for creating it. A group of students led by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and Divya Narendra had been trying to find a programmer for a site they called Harvard Connections when Zuckerberg and several collaborators launched a website with a strikingly similar concept, called ""TheFacebook."" When it launched on February 4, 2004, ""the site's membership was initially limited to Harvard students — with no Like button and no News Feed,"" said Yahoo News . Four months later, Zuckerberg had ""secured an investment of $500,000 from Peter Thiel, PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist."" Meanwhile, as the company was taking off, the Winklevoss brothers and Narendra sued Zuckerberg and obtained ""a settlement in 2008 that included 1.2 million shares in the company each,"" said The Independent . That lawsuit provided much of the drama in Fincher's movie ""The Social Network.""

In its original iteration as ""Thefacebook.com,"" the site ""was just a collection of profiles where people listed their favorite movies, quotes and that sort of thing,"" said Forbes . It was certainly not the first social networking site, an honor that belongs to Classmates.com, launched in 1995, and 1997's Six Degrees, which included ""popular features such as profiles, friends lists and school affiliations in one service,"" said CBS News. But Zuckerberg's site took off and soon eclipsed existing leaders like MySpace.

By the end of 2004, Facebook had more than a million users , and in 2006, Yahoo ""sought to buy Facebook for a billion dollars."" In the end ""Zuckerberg turned them all down,"" said The New Yorker . Membership for the site was initially restricted to people studying at Harvard, and then college and high school students. By 2006, Zuckerberg decided to open up membership on the site to anyone. The company ""needed to relax its membership rules in order to keep up with its existing members after they graduated from college and got jobs,"" said The New York Times . Zuckerberg's big payday arrived in 2012, when he took the company public with an ""initial public offering that valued Facebook at $104 billion,"" a staggering figure that was ""higher than those of McDonald's, Citigroup, Amazon and all but a handful of other American companies.""

A transformation in how people connect to each other

Facebook ultimately ""forever changed how people connect, how businesses make money, how politicians seize power, and how information flows across communities and cultures,"" said Wired . At one time, the site's networking properties were credited with helping dissidents topple authoritarian regimes, including in Egypt during the 2010-2011 Arab Spring . Facebook was a ""place for venting the outrage resulting from years of repression, economic instability and individual frustration,"" said The New York Times , and activists created pages on the site that helped them coordinate efforts to overthrow the country's authoritarian regime. Zuckerberg's hot-or-not site had somehow transformed itself into a tool of revolution.

Not all of those changes are regarded as positive, as Facebook has more recently taken the blame for exacerbating partisan polarization in the United States, acting as a conduit for misinformation and using its algorithms to encourage unhealthy behavior and addiction. In a 2021 CNN poll, more than three-quarters of Americans said ""that Facebook makes society worse, not better,"" and almost half said ""they know someone who they think was persuaded to believe in a conspiracy theory because of content on Facebook,"" said CNN . Facebook is a ""cruel portrait of us,"" all of its users ""entrapped in the recent careless thoughts of a Harvard sophomore,"" said Zadie Smith in The New York Review of Books .

In 2021, Zuckerberg rebranded his company ""Meta"" to lean into the concept of a ""virtual universe where people will roam freely as avatars, attending virtual business meetings, shopping in virtual stores and socializing at virtual get-togethers,"" said The Washington Post . Zuckerberg's Metaverse ""became the obsession of the tech world and a quick hack to win over Wall Street investors,"" but the concept flopped spectacularly because when ""offered the opportunity to try it out, nobody actually used the Metaverse,"" said Business Insider . The company is investing billions in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives, including ""its own humanoid robot hardware, with an initial focus on household chores,"" said Yahoo News . Today, the company has a market cap of $1.69 trillion. Facebook has more than three billion active users worldwide, with another two billion each on Meta platforms Whatsapp and Instagram. The company ""primarily makes money by selling advertising space on its various social media platforms,"" said Investopedia .",0.988,0.049,0.86,0.091

BBC Sarah Wynn-Williams says she watched Facebook grow from ""a front row seat""

A former senior Facebook executive has told the BBC how the social media giant worked ""hand in glove"" with the Chinese government on potential ways of allowing Beijing to censor and control content in China. Sarah Wynn-Williams - a former global public policy director - says in return for gaining access to the Chinese market of hundreds of millions of users, Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, considered agreeing to hiding posts that were going viral, until they could be checked by the Chinese authorities. Ms Williams - who makes the claims in a new book - has also filed a whistleblower complaint with the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging Meta misled investors. The BBC has reviewed the complaint. Facebook's parent company Meta, says Ms Wynn-Williams had her employment terminated in 2017 ""for poor performance"". It is ""no secret we were once interested"" in operating services in China, it adds. ""We ultimately opted not to go through with the ideas we'd explored."" Meta referred us to Mark Zuckerberg's comments from 2019, when he said: ""We could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they [China] never let us in.""

Facebook also used algorithms to spot when young teenagers were feeling vulnerable as part of research aimed at advertisers, Ms Wynn-Williams alleges. A former New Zealand diplomat, she joined Facebook in 2011, and says she watched the company grow from ""a front row seat"". Now she wants to show some of the ""decision-making and moral compromises"" that she says went on when she was there. It is a critical moment, she adds, as ""many of the people I worked with… are going to be central"" to the introduction of AI. In her memoir, Careless People, Ms Wynn-Williams paints a picture of what she alleges working on Facebook's senior team was like. Mr Zuckerberg, she says, did not get up before midday, loved karaoke and did not like to be beaten at board games, such as Risk. ""I didn't realise that you were supposed to let him win. I was a little naive,"" she told us. However, Ms Wynn-Williams says her allegations about the company's close relationship with China provide an insight into Facebook's decision-making at the time.

""China is Mark Zuckerberg's white whale,"" meaning a goal that he obsessively pursued, says Ms Wynn-Williams. The country is the world's biggest social media market, but access to Facebook remains blocked there, alongside the likes of X and YouTube. ""It's the one piece on the board game that he hasn't conquered,"" she says. Ms Wynn-Williams claims that in the mid-2010s, as part of its negotiations with the Chinese government, Facebook considered allowing it future access to Chinese citizens' user data. ""He was working hand in glove with the Chinese Communist Party, building a censorship tool… basically working to develop sort of the antithesis of many of the principles that underpin Facebook,"" she told the BBC. Ms Wynn-Williams says governments frequently asked for explanations of how aspects of Facebook's software worked, but were told it was proprietary information. ""But when it came to the Chinese, the curtain was pulled back,"" she says. ""Engineers were brought out. They were walked through every aspect, and Facebook was making sure these Chinese officials were upskilled enough that they could not only learn about these products, but then test Facebook on the censorship version of these products that they were building."" Meta told the BBC that such claims about China had been ""widely reported"" at the time.

In her SEC complaint, Ms Wynn-Williams also alleges Mr Zuckerberg and other Meta executives had made ""misleading statements… in response to Congressional inquiries"" about China. One answer given by Mr Zuckerberg to Congress in 2018 said Facebook was ""not in a position to know exactly how the [Chinese] government would seek to apply its laws and regulations on content"" Meta told the BBC that Mr Zuckerberg gave accurate testimony, adding it did not operate services in China.

Most Facebook executives didn't allow their own children on Facebook - according to Ms Wynn-Williams. ""They had screen bans. They certainly wouldn't allow them to use the product."" And yet she says reports from 2017 - that the company had been using algorithms to target and categorise vulnerable teens - were true. ""The algorithm could infer that they were feeling worthless or unhappy,"" she alleges. The company - which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp - could, she claims, identify when a teenage girl had deleted a selfie on its platforms, and then notify a beauty company that it would be a good moment to target the child with an advert. Ms Wynn-Williams says she ""felt sick"" at the thought and tried to push back, ""although I knew it was futile"". ""They said: 'The business side thinks this is exactly what we should be doing. We've got this amazing product, we can get young people, which is a really important advertising segment.'"" Meta told the BBC this was false - it has never offered tools to target people based on their emotional state - and that the research it previously did was to help marketers understand how people express themselves on Facebook, not to target ads.

Emma Lynch / BBC Ms Wyn-Williams wants Meta to change as it ""influences so much of our day-to-day life""

Overall, Ms Wynn-Williams says the company has not done enough to address the issue of young people's safety on social media. ""This is one of the most valuable companies in the world. They could invest in this and make it a real priority and do more to fix it."" Facebook said it was transparent about advert-targeting and had shared updates regarding its approach to creating age-appropriate advert experiences for teens. It also said it had introduced ""Teen Accounts"" for tens of millions of young people with built-in protections. It also said it was giving parents more oversight over their teens' use of the app. As well as poor performance, Meta says the 45-year-old was also fired for ""toxic behaviour"" after she had made ""misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment"". But Ms Wynn-Williams told the BBC she was let go after she had complained about inappropriate comments by one of her bosses - Joel Kaplan, who is now Meta's chief global affairs officer. Meta told us she had been paid by ""anti-Facebook activists"" and she was not a whistleblower. ""Whistleblower status protects communications to the government, not disgruntled activists trying to sell books,"" it said.

Despite worrying about the Trump administration’s flurry of anti-LGBTQ+ executive orders in recent weeks, Alan Gentry won’t be marching on Washington anytime soon. He’s been there and done that and, these days, generally prefers to save his IRL activism for local issues in his current hometown of Denver.

But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t care. Gentry is a gay man in his early 50s who gave all his donation money to Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign last year, and in the past month, he took another action in line with his values: He said goodbye to Facebook and Instagram. Gentry knows that one fewer account on the massive social media platforms won’t change the world. “[But] I can change how I work in the world,” he said, “and Mark Zuckerberg and Meta don’t deserve my time.”

It might feel like light-years, but in fact it was only two months ago that Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced major changes to the company’s Hateful Conduct policy, “lifting restrictions on some topics that are part of mainstream discourse,” including “immigration, gender identity and gender.” These changes were presented by Meta as a return to a commitment to free expression and as allowing more speech on the platform.

But what that looks like in practice is that users on any Meta platform—which includes Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp—now have the “freedom” to describe anyone who identifies as transgender or gay as mentally ill and call for the exclusion of the LGBTQ+ community from the military, law enforcement, and teaching jobs. Users can even post content arguing for gender-based bans in significant areas of public life—often relating to the rights of trans women—including bathrooms, sports and sport leagues, health and support groups, and specific schools, as long as any of these views are based in religious beliefs.

Even before the rules changed, anti-trans content in particular was pervasive across Meta’s platforms. Posts promoting so-called conversion therapy and “genocidal calls for the ‘eradication’ of trans people” were left untouched after being reported for violating Meta’s community standards, according to research by GLAAD. But, prior to Jan. 7, this type of content was at least defined as hate speech—which, according to Meta’s definition, meant “dehumanizing speech; statements of inferiority, expressions of contempt or disgust; cursing; and calls for exclusions”—and, as such, could be reported to moderators. Now users have a pass from Meta to say those things openly because that’s what’s in fashion right now.

Gentry put it bluntly: “Zuckerberg gave a road map to people on how to be hateful—you know, ‘You can call gay and trans people mentally ill, we’re going to allow that,’ ” he said. “ ‘Have at it.’ ”

Losing protection from hate speech is a really big deal for LGBTQ+ users, who are already likely to experience more negative interactions online in general. As a result, many queer and trans people, as either a safeguard for their mental health or a small way of fighting back, are deleting their accounts. Since January, posts like “Delete all your Meta profiles,” “If you can stop using Meta, I highly recommend it,” and “Think I’m going to leave Facebook soon” have been active in LGBTQ+ subreddits, with people weighing the pros and cons of leaving and sharing their plans to move elsewhere.

“This is the final straw for me … ~10-ish years of active social media and ~15 years of existence and my [F]acebook account is dead and gone,” wrote one user who identifies as trans. “Good f’ing riddance, but it’s a shame that the parting is on such sour terms.”

Another user, with the flair Ace-ly Genderqueer, wrote: “It’s a nightmare the grip Facebook/Meta has on the population. We need an alternative with the similar ability for groups and events. Open to any suggestions that I could try [to] convince family to connect on.”

It might be tempting to dismiss these changes as the free market at work, but for queer and trans people, this kind of forced digital migration has very real consequences. In a world that is increasingly hostile to us, social media platforms like Facebook have become a vital resource. Whether you’re seeking out queer-friendly medical care, information about local queer events, or just a place to be in community with other isolated queers, Facebook has been and still is the place to go. And not just for older people. “There’s a stereotype that young people don’t use Facebook, like it’s only for old people, but it’s just not really true,” said Megan Lim, an associate professor at the Burnet Institute who studies how LGBTQ+ youth use social media. “Facebook is still one of the most common social media sites that young people have.”

In particular, the Messenger app and Facebook Groups function as semiprivate safer spaces, digital retreats where we can shape our identities and learn about ourselves and what it means to be queer. It’s a source of real pain, grief even, that Meta has chosen to throw us under the bus by legitimizing discrimination against some of its most vulnerable users. But if queer folks are good at anything, it’s seeking out new places to make a home.

Before leaving Facebook and Instagram for good, Gentry joined Bluesky—which first gained popularity with queer and trans users when Twitter was bought by Elon Musk, became X, and was transformed into what many see as an “echo chamber amplifying right-leaning causes.” In a post about his decision to quit Meta, Gentry wrote that “these changes, during a time when LGBTQ+ rights are under attack … are a direct threat to marginalized communities and a failure of responsibility.”

He’s not the only one who feels that way.

“As [a bisexual woman and a] partner of a trans man, I cannot for the life of me support a company whose hate speech policy allows people to insult someone’s gender identity and sexual orientation,” said Emma, another user who has decided to escape Zuck’s products and is encouraging others to do the same on Reddit. “Anyone could bully or make fun of my boyfriend on Facebook or Instagram just because he’s a trans man … I’m gonna permanently delete my Meta accounts and not look back.” Since calling it quits, she’s felt “relief, as well as joy, in finding safer digital spaces.”

For others, like Ari, who is from Poland, dumping Meta isn’t as easy. She uses Facebook, Messenger, and WhatsApp for her career in the media industry. “I couldn’t work without it,” she said. In her personal life, though, Ari has managed to scale back how much she uses Facebook. “It’s a shame because I think I lost some connection with the LGBTQ+ community [there].”

Since she’s been using Facebook less, Ari has also been turning to Reddit and Bluesky, but she’s found those to be pretty U.S.–centric. “It’s a bit of an issue for me because I am European, and I have my European problems,” she said, referring to a lack of local content on other social media. Ari uses Facebook for information she can’t find elsewhere, including local knowledge about safe health care providers, which was fundamental for her transition.

“Facebook gave me a lot of queer spaces; it was very important. In Poland, queer spaces are mainly still on Facebook. There are three main groups.” She still uses the platform to keep up to date with these groups and other LGBTQ+ organizations like Stonewall, even though she’s found “it’s nearly impossible to use Facebook right now” due to a rise in “weird, shitty content [and] a lot of hateful things.”

“It was [about] safety for me,” Ari said. “I got a lot of info from [Facebook groups] because there were pinned posts and a lot of people just talking about their experiences, about their transition, their struggles. I could just truly feel that and not be alone in this.”

Advertisement

Trying to replace an existing platform can be far more stressful than just setting up a new profile, especially when that platform has served a very specific purpose in your life. “There’s a lot of labor involved in actually looking for where those safe spaces are and where you can feel safe and comfortable, and are not necessarily being outed to everyone across your networks through participating there,” said Lim. “So there’s a lot of careful strategic work that has to happen.”

For Gentry, this is an opportunity to shrink his social media use more broadly. When TikTok was banned, he deleted the app and has since removed all Meta apps. “I’ve read three books since I got rid of TikTok,” he said. “I’ve gained so much more time.” But anyone who has tried a digital detox, even for just a few days, knows that it’s no picnic. “There are bars here in Denver that, you know, their only way of marketing is on Facebook,” he said. “I’m not going to be as connected to the LGBTQ+ community because that would be something that would show up on my feed. Now I have to go out and search for that information.

“The other side of that coin, though, is that I find myself going to local gay-friendly media a lot more,” Gentry added.

Looking on the bright side, Jennifer Marino, a senior research fellow at the University of Sydney, sees these changes as an opportunity for us to look for connection outside social media. “I don’t think fighting Facebook and trying to force them to change is necessarily as constructive as considering where else we can put community and where else we can do outreach,” they said.

Moving our networks beyond social media may offer less anonymity and ease, but at least it doesn’t rely on tech billionaires deigning to grant us protection. For community leaders, this might look like founding an in-person queer support group; if you, like Ari, are searching for information about being queer, you might find it at your local LGBTQ+ center (if there is one), library, or even queer-friendly place of worship. “Search for what’s available in your area that could support you, because it’s not just in big cities anymore,” Marino said. “Not everywhere has something, but many places have more than you think.”

The ongoing migration might be painful, but it’s possibly for the best. Being free of Meta’s clutches gives us a chance to define our own community guidelines—to create ways of being together that are rooted in IRL camaraderie and solidarity and are available permanently, not just when a corporation endorses them.

Adi has covered video games, biohacking, and more for The Verge since 2011.

It’s internet safety law season again. After a narrow failure to pass the Kids Online Safety Act in 2024, Congress is now advancing the Take It Down Act, which criminalizes nonconsensual intimate imagery (NCII, once dubbed “revenge porn,” including AI-generated content) and sets requirements for web platforms to remove it. The bill has gained support from First Lady Melania Trump, and President Donald Trump touted it during his joint address to Congress on March 4th, promising he would sign it. In a normal world, this could be a positive step towards solving the real problem of NCII, a problem that AI is making worse.

But we are not in a normal world. Parts of the Take It Down Act are more likely to become a sword for a corrupt presidential administration than a shield to protect NCII victims — and supporters of both civil liberties and Big Tech accountability should recognize it.

The typical discourse around a bill like the Take It Down Act works this way: lawmakers propose a rule that’s supposed to do a good and popular thing, like help victims of nonconsensual sexual images get those images taken down. Civil liberties advocates go “wait a minute, this has a lot of bad side effects!” Then everybody argues. Is it okay to risk platforms removing legally protected speech if they’re removing lots of bad stuff alongside it? Is protecting the right to private encrypted messaging worth the harm of people secretly transmitting harmful content? Does the bill’s language make one set of outcomes more likely than the other, and is there better language that would tip the scales?

These arguments miss the larger current context. No matter how carefully crafted the Take It Down Act is, it won’t be signed by a president who intends to follow it in good faith. It will be selectively enforced by an administration that consistently treats laws as bargaining chips or ammunition, using them to attack political enemies while exempting anyone who earns Trump’s favor. Right now that happens to include several of the internet’s biggest social media companies, and by extension, some of the biggest potential conduits of NCII.

To put it more simply: even if you accept the Take It Down Act’s tradeoffs in the name of making tech companies protect users, in the era of gangster tech regulation, you’re probably not getting the trade.

Even if you accept the tradeoffs, you’re probably not getting the trade

The problem here is an issue that, yes, I understand we’re all tired of thinking about: the constitutional crisis. The Republican-led Congress has willingly forfeited its status as a serious branch of government in 2025. Lawmakers failed to act when President Donald Trump and shadow president Elon Musk began flouting congressional directives, circumventing the legal process and gutting agencies that the legislature established and funded.

This is bad for direct reasons like ebola, of course, but it also means something more fundamental. Congress can no longer meaningfully claim that what it passes are laws. What it makes now are weapons — rules Trump and other parties use only against people they don’t like.

If this sounds paranoid, let’s look at a few legal processes that Trump and his administration have abused over the past several weeks:

Expand the circle of Trump associates and I could go on. Elon Musk using a pet judge and a twisted version of quasi-defamation law to immiserate nonprofits for reporting on X’s white supremacist content. A DC attorney threatening to prosecute Wired staff for reporting on the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The agency designed to enforce laws around online scams dropping lawsuits against allegedly predatory lenders and maybe shutting down.

It’s eminently clear that the Trump administration and its supporters have little interest in consistently applying Congress’ laws, and given that, it’s eminently unclear what any lawmaker acting in good faith expects to happen if they pass new ones.

Let’s look at the Take It Down Act through that lens. In addition to criminalizing the publication or disclosure of real and simulated “nonconsensual intimate physical depictions” of an identifiable person, the law tasks the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with ensuring web platforms establish a process for removing these depictions within 48 hours, at the risk of violating unfair trade practices law.

This part has proven particularly controversial, and it would normally pose complicated questions. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation explains, “although this provision is designed to allow NCII victims to remove this harmful content, its broad definitions and lack of safeguards will likely lead to people misusing the notice-and-takedown system to remove lawful speech.” How much collateral damage, we might typically ask, should we accept to protect people from abuse?

But if any company that woos Trump can avoid following the law, the collateral damage answer is irrelevant — they’ve got no legal reason to do the “protecting people from abuse” part.

In what world does a platform like X have to follow these rules?

Here’s a thought experiment: Elon Musk owns the social media platform X. X is a known spreader of nonconsensual intimate imagery; in 2024, it was used to publicize graphic AI-generated images of Taylor Swift. The company cut large parts of its moderation team under Musk, leaving it with few resources to build and staff the kind of removal system the Take It Down Act requires. But Musk also heads the powerful government pseudo-agency DOGE. DOGE has apparently almost unlimited power to cut other agencies’ funding, and it may have already begun terminations at the FTC.

If X utterly ignores the Take It Down Act, in what world does the FTC step in to stop it?

The same question goes for at least two other social media giants: Meta and TikTok. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has temporarily earned Trump’s approval by doing things like repudiating fact-checking and throwing women and trans people under the Facebook moderation bus. The US government is supposedly going to own half of TikTok. If these companies end up improving their takedown systems, it will be because they’re facing public pressure or what amounts to a Trump extortion opportunity, not fairly applied legal consequences. And maybe you’re thinking, perhaps Trump’s strong personal objections to the abuse of women — the vast majority of NCII victims — mean he won’t tolerate it even among his allies. But let’s be real, you’re probably not.

Under Trump’s intensely fought culture wars, even smaller platforms with unambiguously awful content might get away scot-free. All they have to do is position themselves as victims of “cancel culture” or “wokeness”, and the administration may look the other way. Once you’ve pressured another country’s government to release what a Republican attorney general calls two “publicly admitted” sex traffickers, there’s clearly not much you can’t excuse.

Meanwhile, small services with no such guarantees could operate under a cloud of uncertainty about the risks that groups like the EFF have pointed out.

Is the Take It Down Act a good bill? It doesn’t matter. Its sponsors Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) could have the most immaculately crafted legislative text ever written (in case it’s not clear, they don’t) and it would not change the fact that Congress has accepted it’s passing suggestions, not laws. (Cruz and Klobuchar’s offices didn’t respond by publication time to questions about how the FTC might enforce the law against X.)

Some parts of the Take It Down Act could still probably be enforced in beneficial ways, even if they continue to raise First Amendment questions. Advocates have been pressing for federal laws addressing NCII purveyors for years, and law enforcement could use this one to crack down on some of the people making and intentionally spreading this content. Powerful, high-profile individual offenders that rally political support might still skate, but you’d stand a chance of winning other cases. This is all tradeoff territory.

Given the issues above, though, there’s no reason to believe the Take It Down Act will make most big social companies take NCII more seriously. Instead, the law’s platform provisions could be worse than useless. In general, government-mandated takedown systems are easily abused by private bad actors. (This primarily happens with “copystrike” extortion and censorship, which has grown out of mandatory takedown systems for copyright infringement.)

When laws are just bargaining chips, the people they’re supposed to protect are left behind

More specifically, conservatives have signaled an interest in undercutting supposedly “liberal” platforms — Wikipedia in particular is frequently attacked by Musk and has been targeted by the Heritage Foundation. The Take It Down Act covers online platforms (with the exception of email and a few other carveouts) that “primarily [provide] a forum for user-generated content,” and while Wikipedia isn’t typically in the business of publishing nonconsensual nudes, it seems plausibly covered by some interpretations of the law. The FTC would probably have no compunctions about launching a punitive investigation if trolls start spamming it with deepfakes.

The Take It Down Act’s critics also argue that it could add liability for end-to-end encryption. Those provisions could incentivize companies like Apple — which remains one of the less Trumpy tech players — to remove data protection features, especially amid anti-encryption pressure overseas. It would be an issue under any presidency, but in one that’s blatantly contemptuous of data privacy, the danger is even more pressing.

And once more, even if you think removing encryption is good, there’s an equal chance that Trump just uses the liability threat as leverage — if Tim Cook invests enough money in US factories, iMessage end-to-end security stays on.

In a state of total presidential control all these risks might be a moot point, because the administration wouldn’t need any excuse at all to target its enemies. But we’ve still got a court system that’s putting some (limited and tenuous) checks on it, and a judge can more easily throw out a total nonsense claim. Creating a new pretext could mean longer, costlier battles while courts interpret the statute. The Take It Down Act seems like the online safety law closest to passing, but for the near future, any bill that regulates internet content poses similar risks.

Civil libertarians often warn people to view regulations through the perspective of the worst person you can imagine interpreting them, and I think sometimes this comes off as overly cynical — if you assume every law will be twisted beyond recognition in bizarre ways, then at a certain point no law makes sense. But that whole argument belongs in a world where Congress cares about the executive branch obeying its directives to the letter and the president is not giving constant indications he’ll weaponize them.

For anyone who wants tech platforms to take a stronger stance on nonconsensual intimate imagery, many state-level lawmakers still seem seriously invested in the process of governance. (Nearly all states have some form of NCII ban, though these don’t typically address larger platform issues.) Soft power — protests, boycotts, exposés — can push companies to act, and indeed, several tech companies have introduced new NCII rules over the years. And if Congress decides it’s interested in becoming a real branch of government again, we can restart those endless conversations about safety versus privacy and speech. Until then, the Constitution is the only thing lawmakers seem capable of taking down.",-0.9969,0.14,0.745,0.115

The U.S. Supreme Court ordered Meta to respond to a petition by Children’s Health Defense (CHD) alleging collusion with the Biden administration to censor COVID-19 and vaccine-related content.

CHD was banned from Facebook and Instagram in 2022, claiming its First Amendment rights were violated by Meta’s censorship of scientific discussions.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted government officials pressured the company to remove content, contradicting earlier claims of independent decision-making.

The Supreme Court’s order suggests the justices are seriously considering the case, potentially impacting free speech and censorship laws in the digital age.

The case highlights broader concerns about tech giants’ role in public discourse and government influence over online content moderation.

The U.S. Supreme Court has ordered Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, to respond to a petition filed by Children’s Health Defense (CHD) by March 31.

The petition alleges that Meta colluded with Biden administration officials to censor CHD’s content, particularly regarding vaccines and COVID-19. This move comes after Meta initially waived its right to respond, raising questions about the social media giant’s transparency and its role in suppressing dissenting voices.

The case, which dates back to 2020, has gained renewed attention following Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s public admissions that government officials pressured the company to censor content during the pandemic. CHD, a nonprofit organization advocating for vaccine safety and informed consent, was deplatformed from Facebook and Instagram in August 2022 and has not been reinstated. The Supreme Court’s decision to compel Meta to respond suggests the justices are taking the case seriously, potentially setting the stage for a landmark ruling on censorship and free speech in the digital age.

A battle over free speech and government overreach

CHD’s lawsuit, filed in November 2020, accuses Meta of collaborating with Biden administration officials to suppress its content, including posts about COVID-19 vaccines, natural immunity, and alternative treatments like ivermectin. The organization argues that such censorship violates the First Amendment, particularly when the suppressed information is based on scientific data.

Meta’s actions against CHD began as early as May 2019, with the removal or restriction of posts. By August 2022, the organization was completely banned from Facebook and Instagram. CHD CEO Mary Holland noted that the organization’s ability to share critical health information was stifled at a time when such discussions were most needed.

The timing of the Supreme Court’s order is notable, coming just weeks after Zuckerberg admitted on Joe Rogan’s podcast that government officials “would call up our team and, like, scream at them and curse” to demand the removal of content, even when it was factually accurate. These admissions contradict Meta’s earlier claims in court that its censorship decisions were made independently, without government influence.

Zuckerberg’s admissions raise questions

Zuckerberg’s revelations have added fuel to CHD’s case. In January, less than 24 hours after CHD petitioned the Supreme Court, Zuckerberg announced Meta would end its third-party fact-checking program, a move seen by many as an attempt to distance the company from its controversial censorship practices. However, CHD argues that this change does not absolve Meta of its past actions.

“That the U.S. Supreme Court has now required Meta to respond seems a hopeful sign that the court is taking our petition seriously and that we also will get a chance to respond to Meta’s submission,” said CHD General Counsel Kim Mack Rosenberg.

The case has drawn attention from free speech advocates and legal experts who warn of the dangers of government-led censorship in the digital age. National healthcare attorney Rick Jaffe, who is not directly involved in the case but represents CHD in other matters, called the Supreme Court’s order a “positive indication” that the justices are taking the issue seriously.

“My speculation is that Zuckerberg’s recent admissions, adeptly pointed out by Roger Teich’s supplemental letter to the Court, made some members want a response from Meta,” Jaffe said.

CHD’s fight against Meta is part of a larger battle to hold tech giants accountable for their role in shaping public discourse. As Holland wrote in a recent op-ed, “The American public is better served with more information rather than less, especially when it is grounded in data-based scientific information. People are smart enough to make up their own minds.”

The Supreme Court’s decision to compel Meta to respond to CHD’s petition marks a critical juncture in the ongoing debate over free speech and censorship. With Zuckerberg’s admissions casting doubt on Meta’s claims of independence, the case could set a precedent for how social media platforms navigate their responsibilities in the digital public square. As the March 31 deadline approaches, all eyes will be on the Court to see whether it will take up a case that could redefine the boundaries of free expression in the 21st century.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Why the Fight Against Online Extremism Keeps Failing,"Yes, Big Tech can do more. But all online spaces must commit to a more unified stance against extremism, writes Tamar Mitts.",https://time.com/7264828/online-extremism-fight-failing/,2025-03-06,"When we read about yet another shooting linked to online hate, or another violent network spreading across social media, the common refrain is that “social media platforms must do more.” Indeed, my own research in online extremism and content moderation shows that while content moderation takedowns have soared on major sites over the past several years, extremists still find plenty of digital spaces to recruit, organize, and call for violence. And so, perhaps the question we should be asking isn’t whether platforms are doing enough in isolation—it’s whether we are addressing a problem that is bigger than any one site can handle.

Advertisement Advertisement

Our approach to fighting online hate and extremism focuses too often on individual platforms—Facebook, X, YouTube, or TikTok—and too little on the fragmentation of content moderation across the internet. Historically, when governments scrutinize “Big Tech” and platforms tighten their moderation rules, extremist movements disperse to smaller or alternative platforms. Fewer rules and smaller trust-and-safety teams mean more opportunity to radicalize a dedicated audience while still testing ways to sneak back into bigger platforms. Recently, this has become easier, with some major platforms loosening their content moderation rules under the guise of free speech. Under Elon Musk’s ownership, for example, X (formerly Twitter) sharply reduced its trust-and-safety teams, reinstated banned extremist accounts, and relaxed enforcement of hateful content. Similarly, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, ended its third-party fact-checking program and redefined its hate speech policies so that certain rhetoric once disallowed is now permitted. And because these platforms offer the widest reach, extremists not only regain access to mainstream audiences but also re-enter the cycle of radicalization, recruitment, and mobilization that smaller platforms struggle to sustain.

My research based on extensive multi-platform datasets and case studies of actors across the ideological spectrum shows how extremists build resilience in this uneven landscape. Their strategy is both deliberate and dynamic. They use fringe sites or encrypted messaging apps to post the most incendiary or violent material, bypassing stricter enforcement. Then they craft “toned-down” messages for mainstream platforms—perhaps hateful, but not quite hateful enough to trigger mass takedowns. They harness the resentment of users who feel they’ve been censored on mainstream social media, turning that grievance into part of their rallying cry. This cycle thrives in the cracks of what I like to call the “inconsistent enforcement system”—an ecosystem that, inadvertently or not, allows extremists to adapt, evade bans, and rebuild across platforms. But this piece-meal approach also means that extremist movements are never truly dismantled—only temporarily displaced. Instead of weakening these networks, it teaches them to evolve, making future enforcement even harder.

Trying to fix this with platform-by-platform crackdowns is like plugging a single hole in a bucket riddled with leaks. As soon as you patch one, water pours out through the others. That’s why we need a more ecosystem-wide approach. In certain categories—where the content is nearly universally deemed harmful, such as explicit calls for violence—more consistent moderation across multiple platforms is our best bet. If platforms coordinate their standards (and not just in vague statements but in specific enforcement protocols), that consistency starts to remove the “arbitrage” extremists rely on. Analyses of 60 platforms show that in places where there’s real policy convergence, violent groups find fewer safe havens because they can no longer exploit enforcement gaps to maintain a presence online. When platforms apply similar rules and coordinate enforcement, extremists have fewer places to regroup and less opportunity to shift from one site to another when bans take effect.

Coordinating in this manner isn’t straightforward—content moderation raises concerns about free speech, censorship, and potential abuse by governments or private firms. Nonetheless, for the narrow slice of content that most of us agree is beyond the pale—terrorist propaganda and hate speech advocating violence—aligning standards would close many of the gaping holes. Building robust trust-and-safety capabilities isn’t cheap or simple—especially for smaller platforms that can’t hire hundreds of moderators and legal experts. Enter a new wave of third-party initiatives aiming to do exactly that: ROOST, for example, is funded by a coalition of philanthropic foundations and tech companies like Google, OpenAI, and Roblox. It provides open-source software and shared databases so that platforms, large or small, can better identify and remove extremist material known to incite real-world harm. Projects like this promise a path toward greater convergence, without forcing companies to reinvent moderation from scratch.



Of course, some of the biggest barriers remain political. We still lack consensus on where to draw the line between harmful extremist speech and legitimate political expression. The topic has become deeply polarized, with different actors and stakeholders holding sharply contrasting views on what should be considered harmful. But extremist violence isn’t a partisan issue: from synagogue shootings to the livestreamed violence in Christchurch to a series of Islamist-inspired attacks linked to online radicalization, we’ve already witnessed enough atrocities to know that hate and terror thrive in the seams between platforms.

Yes, we will continue debating the boundaries of harmful content. But most Americans can agree that explicit calls for violence, hate-based harassment, and terror propaganda warrant swift and serious intervention. That shared ground is where multi-platform initiatives like ROOST, or collaborative databases led by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, can make real headway.

Until we address the systemic incentives that enable the migration, coordination, and reemergence of extremist content across platforms, we will keep wondering, after every horrific attack: Why does this keep happening? The answer is that we have built a fragmented system—one where each platform fights its own battle, while extremists exploit the seams.

It’s time to demand not just that “Big Tech do more,” but that all online spaces commit to a more unified stance against extremism. Only then can we begin to dry up the countless leaks that keep nourishing digital hate.",-0.9971,0.14,0.772,0.088
"META Platforms, Facebook.",Social Media Companies Decry YouTube’s Exemption from Australian Ban,"Social media companies have expressed outrage that YouTube is exempt from the forthcoming ban in Australia that bars anyone under the age of 16 from using platforms like TikTok and Instagram.
[Read More]",https://petapixel.com/2025/03/05/social-media-companies-decry-youtubes-exemption-from-australian-ban/,2025-03-05,"Social media companies have expressed outrage that YouTube is exempt from the forthcoming ban in Australia that bars anyone under the age of 16 from using platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

The landmark legislation was approved by Australia’s parliament in November and when it comes into effect toward the end of 2025, it will set a benchmark for strict social media rules.

Google has successfully lobbied the Australian government to remove YouTube from the list of banned platforms which includes TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, and X. The companies are liable for fines of up to $49.5 million Australian dollars ($32 million) if they fail to prevent children from holding accounts.

YouTube is exempt from the ban because it has been deemed a key educational tool and children will be allowed to access the service as part of a family account, supervised by parents.

However, Meta has taken exception to this: arguing that a user experiences algorithmic reccomendations, social interaction, and exposure to harmful content — features that were cited by Australia to justify the ban.

“YouTube’s exemption is at odds with the purported reasons for the law and we call on the government to ensure equal application of the law across all social media services,” says Meta. “Given YouTube is the most popular social media service among young Australians, its exclusion from the ban law is in direct contradiction to the government’s stated intent.”

TikTok, meanwhile, calls YouTube’s exclusion a “sweetheart deal”, decrying it as “irrational and indefensible.”

“While experts may debate the merits of restricting teens’ access to social media, now that Parliament has delivered its verdict, Australians deserve a system that works and industry deserves a level playing field,” TikTok says in a statement.

“Handing one major social media platform a sweetheart deal of this nature — while subjecting every other platform in Australia to stringent compliance obligations — would be illogical, anti-competitive, and shortsighted.”

A mental health and extremism expert tells Reuters that YouTube can pose exactly the same sort of risk to children as other sites. YouTube, for its part, says it has ramped up moderation efforts and is broadening its definition of harmful content.

Social shift ahead. The decline of big social media platforms is accelerating, and this is reshaping how brands should approach customer engagement.

Trust on trial. Consumers trust user-generated content far more than influencer promotions, which signals a shift in what drives brand credibility.

Own your channels. Brands must invest in direct channels like websites, apps and email to regain control over customer relationships.

A few years from now, we may look back on 2025 as the beginning of the end of two long-standing mega pillars of the internet.

The first is Google’s domination of the search engine marketplace, which is being disrupted by generative AI platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity, with Google’s market share falling below 90% for the first time since 2015. Antitrust issues aside, there are plenty of reasons to believe it will never be that high ever again.

The second is the end of the era of big social media platforms.

Let’s look at the crumbling that’s already started, where things are likely headed and why the momentum isn’t likely to let up.

Table of Contents

The Canary in the Coal Mine

Before its acquisition by Elon Musk, Twitter was widely viewed as the world’s digital town square. Since its transformation into X, it’s become a shadow of its former self, more of a ghost town than the world’s town square.

Since Musk purchased the platform in 2022 for $44 billion, X’s valuation has plunged. According to Fidelity’s valuation of its investment in X, the platform’s worth has fallen by 79% to just $9.4 billion. Brand Finance is even less generous, valuing it at just $498 million earlier this year.

This change of fortune was driven by an 80% reduction in staff, which notably included all of its content moderation staff and partners. That change directly led to a marked decline in content quality and negative shift in tone. This caused millions of active users to leave the platform, and it raised brand safety concerns among advertisers, many of which reduced or ended their advertising. As a result, X is “barely breaking even” and has sued its former advertisers, claiming conspiracy.

That chain of events is important because of what happened next.

Meta Doubles Down on the Wrong Lessons

On Jan. 7, a couple of weeks before Donald Trump’s inauguration, Facebook founder and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company would be “restoring free expression on our platforms” by getting rid of fact-checkers, removing restrictions on controversial topics like immigration and gender, dialing back other content filters, increasing recommendations of political content and “going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world going after American companies and pushing to censor more.”

Zuckerberg explicitly says they’re going to be doing things “similar to X” and rolling those changes out across Facebook, Instagram and Threads.

Based on what’s happened at X, there’s every reason to believe that these changes will cause many unintended consequences.

Many Meta users may spend less time on its platforms or depart for other platforms like Mastodon and Bluesky, which have benefited tremendously from X’s similar policy shifts.

Advertisers may pull back or depart out of concern for brand safety.

Foreign governments may levy additional fines or further restrict Meta’s activities in their nations, worsening its already poor relations.

One of Meta’s early attempts at rolling back content moderation resulted in Instagram users seeing violent and graphic content recommended in their Reels feeds, which led to a flood of user complaints.

Social Media as a Black Box

The double-whammy of lower user engagement and advertiser pullbacks is likely to be devastating, just as it’s been at X. Making matters worse is the fact that social networks have gradually restricted organic brand reach to near zero over the years.

What little organic traffic that exists is often obscured by these platforms, according to SparkToro. And cookie consent is further complicating attribution, suppressing conversion tracking by up to 20%, according to Orbit Media. All of that has further discouraged brands from investing much in an organic presence on social media platforms.

As a result, when brands pull back from social media advertising, they’re often left with a minimal direct presence. That said, some may have an indirect presence via influencers, but even that is on shaky ground.

Influencer Fatigue

Plenty of consumers feel a kinship with their favorite influencers. That’s particularly true of younger consumers in Gen Z.

However, in general, trust is slipping. A common consumer belief today is that most influencers only endorse and promote products because they’re paid to, not because they use or even like the product.

According to a survey by EnTribe, 81% of consumers said a brand’s use of influencers has either no impact or a negative impact on their perception of that brand. Fifty-one percent said they scroll right past influencer posts, in much the same way that consumers ignore ads. When asked if their purchases were ever impacted by an influencer, 62% said they’ve never purchased an influencer-promoted product, while 42% of those who had purchased an influencer-promoted product said they regretted doing so.

The most shocking evidence that the influencer market has peaked is that 86% said they’re more likely to trust a brand that publishes user-generated content, compared to just 12% who said they’re inclined to purchase a product promoted by an influencer.

Bots Are Taking Over — and Everyone Knows It

Authenticity and trust are being further undermined by AI bots, which in some cases are being directly created and enabled by social media platforms. For instance, Meta created Facebook and Instagram AI bots for living celebrities, dead famous people and others. Meta also allows Instagram users to create AI versions of themselves to interact with their followers (seemingly to save them from having to waste their time doing so).

These programs aren’t fringe. They’re core to social media’s future. Meta has even told The Financial Times that it envisages social media filled with AI-generated users.

To their credit, these AI bots are clearly labeled. But it conjures up a dystopian future where we all create AI versions of ourselves that chat with one another and periodically update us about the fake conversations our fake selves are having with all the other fake people. That’s a far cry from the original promise of social media. In fact, we probably won’t call it “social” media at that point.

Of course, all of that is on top of the enduring problem of run-of-the-mill fake accounts. Facebook alone removes around 1 billion fake accounts each quarter.

Take Back What You Can Control

If you throw in the uncertainty swirling around TikTok, social media has never looked more shaky. Still huge, but shaky.

The natural response from brands should be to counterbalance that uncertainty by investing more in channels they have much more control over, including websites, apps, customer loyalty programs, email, SMS (RCS), mobile and browser push, and podcasts.

In addition to building up first-party audiences, which give you much more direct and unmediated relationships with your customers and prospects, investing in these channels also gives you many opportunities to collect first-party data. This data is vital for driving message targeting, ad targeting and analytics that get us closer to our customers.

The internet is undergoing massive changes. And if Twitter’s transformation into X demonstrates anything, it’s that big changes can happen faster than you think. Every brand should be watching carefully and coming up with contingency plans before they realize they’re a few years too late.

Core Questions About the Decline of Big Social Media

Editor's note: Key questions surrounding the decline of major social media platforms and how brands should adapt their customer engagement strategies.

How is the collapse of big social media changing customer engagement?

As trust in major social media platforms declines, brands are shifting their focus toward direct engagement strategies such as email marketing, owned communities and first-party data collection. Consumers are looking for more meaningful interactions, prompting businesses to invest in personalized customer experiences outside of traditional social media channels.

What role does user-generated content (UGC) play in brand credibility?

With consumers increasingly skeptical of paid influencer promotions, authentic user-generated content has become a powerful trust-building tool. Brands that encourage customers to share real experiences—through testimonials, reviews, and organic social posts—see stronger engagement and credibility compared to those relying on traditional advertising.

Why should brands invest in owned channels over social media?

Brands that rely heavily on platforms like X and Meta face risks due to algorithm changes, declining organic reach and shifting audience behaviors. Investing in owned channels such as company websites, email newsletters and brand communities provides greater control over customer relationships and reduces dependence on unpredictable third-party platforms.

How can brands mitigate the risks of AI-generated content and fake engagement?

AI-generated interactions and fake engagement on social media are eroding trust. To counter this, brands are prioritizing authenticity by fostering real customer conversations, leveraging human-led content creation, and verifying the credibility of online interactions. Transparency about AI usage in customer engagement is also key to maintaining consumer trust.

What are the long-term implications of social media’s decline for digital marketing?

The decline of traditional social media is pushing marketers toward more diversified digital strategies. SEO-driven content, community-based marketing and personalized experiences are becoming more effective than broad social media outreach. Businesses that focus on building loyal audiences through multiple touchpoints will be better positioned for long-term success.

Now, you’re spoiled for choice when it comes to the sheer volume of data available to help you measure the performance of your content.

Instagram analytics can be a goldmine of insights for you as a creator or small business owner. These numbers can shape your Instagram strategy, helping you pinpoint exactly what kind of content will boost your reach and help grow your audience.

But how do you get these insights? How do you spot patterns, connect the dots, and use your performance numbers to inform your strategy? And — best question yet — are there handy tools that can do the work for you?

In this article, I’ll take you through the most important Instagram analytics and share tool recommendations that can consolidate those goldmine insights for you.

Which Instagram metrics should you care about?

There are plenty of numbers in Instagram analytics tools. Should you be monitoring all of them? You can, but it’s not essential. Prioritize tracking a few key metrics that help you determine whether or not you’re achieving your social media goals .

For most creators, and some brands, reaching as many people as possible is likely your primary goal.

If that’s the case, Instagram head Adam Mosseri recommends keeping an eye on average watch time, like rate, and send rate. ( embed post )

But there is more nuance involved here if your social media strategy is concerned with more than eyeballs. For example, Instagram coach, Elise Darma , shared she pays attention to the metrics that have a direct impact on her business, including:

How many people are moving from her content into meaningful conversations in DMs

The quality of comments and engagement on her posts

How many non-followers are discovering her content

Here’s a table to help you understand the key Instagram metrics and when you should prioritize tracking them.

Metric What this metric signifies Prioritize tracking and improving this metric when Post-specific engagement metrics How many views, likes, comments, and shares your single Instagram post has When you want to grow your personal brand on Instagram and increase your followers Overall engagement metrics How many people you engaged over a period — divided by content type and type of interaction (like vs. saves vs. shares) When you want to understand which content type reaches the most new people and which gets the most engagement (and whether or not they overlap) Accounts reached How many followers and non-followers you have reached via your Instagram content When you want to increase your Instagram reach and build an audience on the platform Audience demographics Where your Instagram followers live, their gender, and age When you want to ensure you’re reaching your target audience on Instagram Accounts reached bifurcated via content types Which kinds of posts (Posts, Stories, Reels) helped you reach followers vs. non-followers When you want to determine your most successful content type to reach new people in your target audience Follower growth How many people have followed and unfollowed you over a specific duration When you want to evaluate how your followers are increasing or decreasing over time Most active times When your audience is online When you want to find the best time to post on Instagram for you Profile visits How many people visited your profile in a specific timeline When you want to increase brand awareness External link taps How many times someone clicked a link in your bio When you want to measure website visitors via Instagram

These Instagram metrics are readily available in the app itself. All Instagram analytics tools have these insights and then some.

Should you monitor Instagram analytics only for your hit posts? Or only for the posts that performed below average? Elise recommends monitoring every single post:

“Here's the thing about metrics — every post is data, even the ones that seem to ""flop."" Instead of getting caught up in day-to-day numbers, use each post as an experiment. What's working? What's not? Then use those insights to refine your strategy.”

How to view your Instagram analytics in the app

All core Instagram analytics are available in the app. You must have a business or creator account on Instagram to view your insights.

There are two ways to view your Instagram analytics on the app:

1. View a single Instagram post’s insight

2. View your Instagram account’s performance as a whole

To view a single post or reel’s highlight, click on ‘View insights’ attached at the bottom of every post. You’ll find likes, shares, comments, and saves for that post. You can also see how many accounts you’ve reached with a single post, where those accounts came from (home, explore, profile, etc.), and how many were new accounts.

To view your Instagram account insights as a whole, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Instagram profile

2. Click on the three horizontal lines at the top right to go to ‘Setting and activity’

3. Tap on ‘Insights’ to view Instagram insights

Inside the analytics tab, you can find your Instagram’s key metrics in one of three categories:

Views: To see your profile activity, audience demographics, top-performing posts, and ratio of followers vs. non-followers.

Interactions: To see how many Instagram accounts you’ve engaged and the number of likes, saves, replies, and shares on your posts and Instagram Stories.

Total followers: To see how your follower growth has fluctuated in a specific period (but no more than 90 days) and follower demographics.

If you have an Instagram business account, you can also view insights for Instagram and Facebook side-by-side on the Meta Business Suite .

The insights in Meta Business Suite are more comprehensive than Instagram’s app. You can add your competitors and do a thorough competitive analysis of your page vs. theirs, see all the content you’ve posted and how it performed, and get a detailed audience analysis.

But still, viewing Instagram analytics natively over using an analytics tool has many disadvantages:

You have to connect the dots: You have to slice and dice the data yourself to determine key Instagram insights like best times to post, ideal posting frequency , and best types of posts. You only get the surface-level analytics and have to do the math for the rest yourself. You can’t brand the reports you create from Instagram insights or Meta Business Suite. Most Instagram analytics tools allow you to create white-labeled reports in a few clicks and handpick the metrics you want to display. You can’t view Instagram insights beyond 90 days. This means you can’t evaluate year-long campaigns as a social media manager. Or if you're a creator experimenting with new kinds of posts every three months, you can't compare your experiments against each other.

These cons become even sharper as your social media marketing strategy evolves. For example, if you’re pursuing influencer marketing on Instagram, you can’t manually evaluate a creator’s profile on how their paid posts perform, audience demographics, overall reach, etc.

You’ll either need to ask for each Instagram influencer’s media kit (exhausting) or add Instagram analytics tools to help you get these insights.

The gist of it: Use Instagram’s native capabilities when you need a free Instagram analytics tool. But as soon as you get some budget to work with, you’re probably going to be better off with one of the tools below.

What should you look for in an Instagram analytics software? Evaluate your needs first.

Do you need a strong reporting tool to create Instagram analytics reports? Social media managers might have an extra requirement for this feature, while creators can do without it.

Are you a social media marketing agency? You might need a strong Instagram analytics dashboard to get your clients’ current metrics in a jiffy.

Solo marketer working with a tight budget? You need flexible Instagram analytics tools that also double as a social media management platform.

Creator building a personal brand? Look for more affordable Instagram analytics tools.

Your reporting needs and budget should determine which Instagram analytics tool is right for you. I’ve tried to include at least one Instagram analytics software for every use case.

1. Buffer

Best Instagram analytics tool for those who need a social media management platform

Free trial: Free plan available with few analytics

Price: Starts at $6/month

Buffer is the best Instagram analytics tool for people who need a one-stop shop for all the work that goes into social media. It’s a social media management platform, so not only does it give you detailed analytics about your Instagram account, but also helps you:

Store content ideas

Respond to comments

Schedule social media posts

Use AI to refine social media captions

…and a host of other things.

I personally use Buffer to manage my social media efforts, and my favorite thing is how easy it is to use. There’s no ‘learning curve’ — you can just get right to work!

In terms of Instagram analytics, you get a comprehensive analytics dashboard that won’t just show you the numbers. It will give you specific, personal recommendations based on your content performance: best time to post, type of post, and posting frequency. It does all the math, and then some.

You can also create beautiful and customized reports and white-label them (really handy if you’re a social media manager presenting to a client, or a creator pitching a brand partnership)

The best part? These social media analytics are available for most of the platforms Buffer supports, not just Instagram! There’s no better way to analyze your social media marketing strategy or creator presence as a whole.

2. SocialBlade

Best Instagram analytics tool for getting basic analytics

Source: SocialBlade

Free trial: Analyze one Instagram profile for free every day

Price: Starts at $3.99/month

SocialBlade is one of the best Instagram analytics apps if you want something free and basic. It doesn’t have all the bells and whistles — it only tells you follower fluctuation, average likes and comments, and engagement rate.

It’s not an ideal software for someone looking for valuable insights to inform their Instagram marketing strategy. But it might be the right choice for social media managers handling influencer marketing campaigns, and to monitor an influencer’s follower growth.

It’s worth remembering that Social Blade primarily only shows follower growth. It doesn’t have charts or numbers for how an Instagram profile’s engagement rate has gone up and down.

What is particularly helpful, though, is that Social Blade has 30-day data on follower growth or decline — helping you pinpoint which post(s) exactly helped gain or lose followers.

How to use your Instagram analytics

Instagram analytics tools are great, but they can’t tell you what you should do with the raw data. Deeper insights are always contextual — so you have to find how Instagram analytics inform your strategy.

If you’ve started out by setting goals, monitor how closely you achieved your objectives. Which metrics did you achieve easily? Which KPI did you struggle to hit?

Once you’ve done this, zoom out and look at the performance data more broadly. What went unexpectedly? Maybe your Instagram audience analytics show a bigger market than you had anticipated. Perhaps the Instagram algorithm changed and your analytics shifted with it. Track engagement metrics to understand which types of Instagram posts did well. Spot patterns in what did well and why.

Dissecting your social media analytics will not only help you create more well-informed Instagram analytics reports, but also help you move your overall social strategy in the right direction.",0.9999,0.011,0.815,0.174
"META Platforms, Facebook.",AI Briefing: Ad verification’s duarchy touts AI to Wall Street amid expansion plans,DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science issued earnings calls after critical reports.,http://digiday.com/media-buying/ad-verifications-duarchy-touts-ai-to-wall-stret-amid-expansion-plans/,2025-03-03,"DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science have spent years as rivals focused on brand safety and verification, tasked with protecting the world’s biggest brands from showing up in problematic places. However, as recent reports show, things can slip through the cracks.

Now, they’re moving beyond the open web, using AI offerings — some built internally and some acquired — to compete for new types of advertisers in new ad arenas.

Both companies, which reported earnings late last week, showed off their road map for winning over mid-market advertisers across new channels like social media, CTV, and retail media. They’re also moving beyond the thorny issue of brand safety to try and prove themselves in yet another tricky area: performance and measurement.

As for the numbers themselves

DoubleVerify reported fourth-quarter revenue growing 11% year over year to $191 million. Total revenue for 2024 grew 15% year over year to $657 million.

Meanwhile, IAS reported fourth-quarter revenue of $153 million, a 14% increase year over year. Total revenue for 2024 also grew to $530 million, a 12% increase over 2023.

DoubleVerify, which missed expectations, saw its stock price fall 35%. On the other hand, IAS beat expectations and saw its stock price jump 10%.

DoubleVerify’s overall measurement revenue grew 7% to $64 million, activation revenue rose 10% in Q4 to $110 million and supply-side revenue jumped 34% to $17 million. Meanwhile, IAS saw optimization and measurement saw year-over-year growth of 11% and 12%, publisher revenue jumped by 30%.

Moving mid-market

On a call with analysts, DoubleVerify CEO Mark Zagorski described 2025 as a “transition year” following what he acknowledged was a disappointing quarter. He said DoubleVerify is still in the investment phase of building out new tools across social, sell-side tools, outcomes and attribution.

One part of the plan is the newly announced $85 million deal to buy Rockerbox to help build out new capabilities around performance attribution and optimization. Rockerbox, which DoubleVerify estimates will contribute around $8 million in revenue this year, will also help unlock a new segment of mid-market, direct-response advertisers to widen its addressable market. Zagorski emphasized the deal fits into DoubleVerify’s broader strategy of transforming its business from a static verification exercise into something more holistic.

“You have to innovate, or you will die,” Zagorski said. “So we think there’s an opportunity for us to continue to invest in growth.”

Some ad tech experts say buying Rockerbox makes strategic sense and will help compete in curated media buying and measurement. Others wonder if it might compromise the third-party verifier’s neutrality but say it might also give DoubleVerify more incentive to improve media quality.

The acquisition could help with DoubleVerify’s push to attract small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) and expand beyond brand safety into performance validation.

Karsten Weide, an analyst at W Media Research, said it could also give DoubleVerify a performance edge against competitors like IAS and Human — and against Adjust and AppsFlyer, which don’t have media quality expertise.

“The opportunities this acquisition presents are substantial,” Weide wrote in a post about the deal. “First, it broadens DV’s [sic] total addressable market by targeting small to mid-sized performance companies, a segment historically underserved by its enterprise-focused offerings.”

Industry analysts are split on the deal’s financial logic. Weide said the $85 million price tag is steep, especially if Rockerbox is only expected to generate only $8 million in revenue this year. However, Gartner analyst Andrew Frank said $85 million is a “pretty small deal in the overall scheme of things.” He’s interested in Rockerbox’s use of synthetic data — a growing trend in AI adoption — to model missing exposures and infer ads that may have contributed to a sale.

“It’s going to plug more and more holes in the targeting and measurement foundation, which has been a growing problem for a lot of advertisers as well as the publishers who are trying to convince them that the ads are worth it,” Frank said.

On Integral Ad Science’s earnings call with analysts, CEO Lisa Utzschneider said there’s a lot of room to go after mid-market advertisers. She defined the category as companies that generate between $200,000 and $1 million in revenue for IAS. “We are investing both in the front end in investing in more sellers, more support, more technical support,” Utzschneider said. “And on the back end, performance really matters to the mid-market advertisers. So pouring fuel on our performance products, investing in automation and self-serve.”

Outside the open web, into walled gardens

DoubleVerify and IAS have expanded efforts across social media offering more measurement and activation within walled gardens like Meta and TikTok. Last month, both announced new content-level avoidance integrations for Facebook and Instagram Feeds and Reels.

Like its rival, IAS is working to bring its AI offerings into walled gardens. Last month, it announced content blocklist optimization tools across Meta’s platforms. Earlier this year, IAS debuted a new deal with Reddit to let advertisers integrate AI tools from IAS to measure brand safety and suitability campaigns.

So far, DoubleVerify only measures 5% of all U.S. social impressions, but it’s already become a $110 million business, Zagorski said. DoubleVerify also sees both Rockerbox and Scibids playing roles in social media by combining Rockerbox’s performance data and Scibids’ AI optimization. DoubleVerify plans to use its Universal Content Intelligence AI platform to help advertisers avoid unsuitable content and optimize performance. It has also expanded its brand safety tools across TikTok and YouTube.

One analyst asked if Meta’s plans to pull back from fact-checking might give IAS an inroad. Utzschneider said it’s too soon to tell but also noted the topic came up a lot during CES in meetings with advertisers.

“I will say our role in the digital ecosystem, our role in providing a best-in-class multimedia classification in all of the major live feeds of social platforms, is a tailwind for our business,” she said. “The brands were very clear during CES….They’re leaning into us to help navigate with them the environment that we’re operating in right now, and that’s a big reason why we continue to invest deeply in our tech.”

The shadow of Adalytics

DoubleVerify and IAS have both been under increased pressure to improve their brand safety efforts following the recent Adalytics report and subsequent letters from Congress expressing concerns about everything from URL reporting to more transparency into how its AI systems operate.

Adalytics wasn’t mentioned on either earnings call, but some of the questions analysts asked seemed to have it in mind. One analyst asked about DV’s plans to expand URL-level reporting. Zagorski noted it’s more about making features more broadly available than offering anything new and added that it’s “more of a transparency initiative than an actual revenue or growth driver.”

“It kind of shows our commitment to driving greater transparency in the ecosystem to giving our advertisers comfort and confidence in where and how they’re buying,” Zagorski said. “…We look at it as part of our responsibility in driving trust in the ecosystem.”

Whether advertisers will continue to trust DoubleVerify and IAS with their spend is something Wall Street will have to wait until next quarter to find out.",0.9991,0.018,0.857,0.125

So far, the…",https://www.adweek.com/social-marketing/can-elon-musk-bend-marketers-to-his-will/,2025-02-28,"During peak pearl-clutching over Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover, the conventional wisdom in the marketing world was that after changing the name, firing 80% of staff, and alienating advertisers, the newly renamed X was on the short road to oblivion.

So far, the conventional wisdom has been spectacularly wrong. Not only is Musk on top of the world, X appears to be more relevant than ever. Predictions of audience collapse haven’t come to fruition, and Musk has used his megaphone on X to drive value for Tesla, SpaceX, and of course himself, in the form of a White House role.

Advertisers are also returning. Amazon is the most recent to amp up its spend, joining names like IBM, Comcast, Disney, and Warner Bros. that have flipped the switch back on. This despite X making zero concessions around the looser content moderation policies and replatforming of unsavory voices that drove advertisers away in the first place.

What changed?

Of many factors, the first is simply that there aren’t any other platforms that do X as well as X does X. Journalist J Wortham recently noted that they, and many others, are willing to tolerate the noxious content on X because there’s no legit alternative, particularly in the realms of real-time news and events. Throw in a CEO with a direct line (for now) to a mercurial president and a panoply of communities that are harder to reach elsewhere, and X and its 600 million monthly users don’t look so bad.

Another factor is cultural. We’ve been awash in so much toxic discourse for so long that people are no longer shocked by it. And on the flip side, for millions of users, they’re not on X despite what polite society might consider toxic content—they’re there specifically for it.

Nothing drives this shift home more emphatically than the fact that the vastly more successful Meta is following X’s lead in doing away with human content moderators across its own platforms. In fact, with Facebook and Instagram so much larger than X, Meta may be the one to realize the greatest savings from this “moderation lite” approach.

Compounding the irony is that Musk doesn’t really want to be in the advertising business in the first place. Not only is his native antipathy to ads well known, but Twitter before Musk was always considered something of an advertising also-ran—hence his push from day one to find new revenue streams, whether selling premium subscriptions, introducing AI tools, or launching the soon-to-debut X Money.

Of course, Musk can’t quit ads just yet. But if he has to sell ads, he’s clearly going to try to do it on his terms. Witness him at the 2023 DealBook Summit telling Andrew Ross Sorkin in colorful language that he wasn’t going to let advertisers like Disney “blackmail” him with their advertising dollars into toeing a particular political line.

Yet despite (or because of?) this belligerence, the market and culture have undeniably moved in his direction. Whether that translates into more ad dollars for X is yet to be determined. What isn’t in doubt is that many advertisers are actively resetting their priorities and politics in ways more in line with what could be considered the harder-edged Muskian worldview. They still might not bring him their media spend, but they’ve already sort of brought him their souls.",0.9299,0.031,0.908,0.061
"META Platforms, Facebook.",Meta Plans Standalone AI App To Compete With ChatGPT And DeepSeek,"Meta is reportedly planning to launch a standalone app for its AI assistant, Meta AI, in an effort to compete directly with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and the Chinese chatbot DeepSeek.

Currently, Meta AI is integrated across the company’s platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Threads, and WhatsApp. However, a dedicated app would allow users to access the AI without needing to engage with Meta’s social media services.

According to sources cited by CNBC, this move aligns with Meta’s broader strategy of making its AI more widely accessible. ChatGPT and DeepSeek already offer standalone applications, making interactions more seamless and convenient for users. By introducing an independent Meta AI app, the company aims to attract individuals who are interested in AI-powered chat but may not use Meta’s other products.

This strategy is similar to what Meta has done with Instagram’s Reels, which was separated from the main app to better engage users who prefer short-form videos. The expected launch of the Meta AI app is set for the second quarter of 2025, meaning it could be available between April and June.

The standalone app is likely to include the same AI-driven features already available within Meta’s existing platforms. However, industry analysts believe that this launch could also pave the way for a paid subscription model for Meta AI in the future. By offering premium features or an ad-free experience, Meta could explore new revenue streams in the competitive AI chatbot market.

As of now, Meta has not officially confirmed these plans or provided further details about the potential app. However, if launched, it would represent a significant step in the company’s AI expansion strategy, positioning Meta AI as a direct rival to other leading chatbot platforms.

This move signifies a strategic shift to broaden the accessibility of Meta's AI assistant, Meta AI, beyond its current integrations within Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.

According to reports, Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has emphasized the transformative potential of Meta AI, projecting that it could reach up to 1 billion users within the year. Currently, the AI assistant serves approximately 700 million monthly active users. To support this ambitious expansion, Meta has allocated between $60 billion and $65 billion for capital expenditures this year, underscoring its commitment to enhancing AI infrastructure and capabilities.

In addition to the standalone app, Meta plans to test a paid subscription service for Meta AI, aligning with monetization strategies employed by competitors. This subscription model is expected to offer advanced features and capabilities, providing users with an enhanced AI experience.

Meta AI, launched in September 2023, utilizes large language models to perform a variety of tasks, including answering questions, generating images, and editing photos. Recent updates have introduced memory features, enabling the AI to offer more personalized recommendations by retaining context from previous interactions. The forthcoming standalone app is anticipated to make Meta AI more accessible to users who are not active on Meta's social media platforms, thereby expanding its reach and user base. This development positions Meta to compete more directly in the rapidly evolving AI chatbot market, which has seen significant advancements and user adoption in recent years.

As the launch approaches, further details regarding the app's features, availability, and subscription options are expected to be announced, providing users with more information on how they can engage with Meta's latest AI offerings.

The CRTC’s operations are mostly funded by fees charged to the companies it regulates. Because of this, the Online News Act included Cost Recovery Regulations that apply to what the commission calls digital news intermediaries, referring to online platforms like Google that make news content available to Canadians.

Google, naturally, disputed the cost recovery. In an intervention the company filed with the CRTC, it argued that it incurred lower regulatory costs by striking a deal with the Canadian Journalism Collective to contribute $100 million to news businesses in Canada. Because of that deal, the CRTC didn’t oversee mandatory bargaining between Google and news business, thus lowering the regulatory cost for the commission.

Elsewhere, Google argued that it shouldn’t be required to pay the entirety of the CRTC’s regulatory costs despite being the only company to which cost recovery would currently apply. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, avoided regulation by removing news content from its platforms in Canada.

The CRTC, however, decided against Google. It acknowledged that Google’s deal would lower regulatory costs for the commission and said that this, in turn, would lower the costs passed on to Google. Similarly, the CRTC said that if there is only one company regulated under the Online News Act, it must charge that company for all the costs of regulating.

The Cost Recovery Regulations will come into effect starting April 1, 2025.

No surprise there. It’s had a head start, fine-tuning its monetization model while others scramble to keep up. And with U.S. creators expected to rake in over $15 billion from social media alone this year, according to eMarketer, the stakes have never been higher. For platforms, courting creators isn’t just a strategy, its table stakes. And more often than not, the winning move comes down to cold, hard cash.

“If you asked 10 creators what platform they prefer for monetizing outside of brand partnerships, you’d probably get at least nine (if not all) saying YouTube,” said Keith Bendes, chief strategy officer at Linqia. “Interestingly though, if you asked 10 brands which platform they prefer for creator partnerships, you’d probably get nine (or all of them) saying Instagram or TikTok.”

Call it a disconnect, or just a difference in priorities. Either way, creators know one thing for certain: their best bet is diversifying revenue streams. After all, they’re building businesses on borrowed land.

Digiday took a closer look at which platforms are cutting the biggest checks, which still come with questions and which are just getting started in the creator monetization game.

YouTube: the gold standard for creator monetization

YouTube has long been known as the king of creator monetization, with its well established YouTube Partner Program (YPP) that launched back in May 2007. Far more superior than a creator fund, YouTube’s revenue share program offers a 50/50 split for creators who produce long-term content. For those producing Shorts, 45% of the revenue goes to creators, while YouTube takes a 55% cut.

To be eligible, creators must have at least 1,000 subscribers on their channel, plus 4,000 valid public watch hours in the last 12 months (on long form content), or 10 million valid public Shorts views in the last 90 days.

Snapchat: the underdog slowly winning creators’ attention

One of the newer platforms to the revenue share model, having previously been criticized for the dwindling pots of creator fund cash, Snapchat is definitely trying to up its game. And it must be working, since creators, for the most part, seem to be far more open to jumping on the app. While it didn’t provide exact figures, Snapchat shared that the number of creators posting content grew around 50% year-over-year in Q3 2024, when it launched its Find Your Favorites campaign last month.

“Snap offers creators a relatively lower lift way to earn money and it seems to be effective,” said Billion Dollar Boy’s founder and group CEO Ed East. “It’s a good option if creators already have a strong audience and want to connect with them more directly and earn money from it.”

The platform recently spruced up its creator monetization programs by unifying the offerings. Now, under the updated Snapchat Monetization Program, creators can earn their dollars for eligible content within Stories as well as Spotlights that are longer than one minute. Though the platform hasn’t disclosed its revenue share split figures.

Sounds easy right? Well, Snapchat does expect some commitment from creators if it’s going to hand out cash. Eligible creators must be 18 years old or older, have at least 50,000 followers on their public profile and have achieved one of the following within the last 28 days:

10 million Snap views

1 million Spotlight views

12,000 hours of viewing time

And as for the content, creators are expected to post at least 25 times per month to Saved Stories or Spotlight, post to either Spotlight or Public Stories on at least 10 of the last 28 days, as well as ensure the content they publish is original and advertiser-friendly.

TikTok: the platform with options

TikTok has numerous ways in which creators can earn some cash, including getting involved in its revenue share program, and its updated creator rewards program.

Top creators (those who produce content within the top 4% of all videos on TikTok) can take part in TikTok Pulse — TikTok’s revenue share model, which splits the cash 50/50 between creators and the platform.

When it comes to creator funds, TikTok’s first attempt didn’t go down too well. For a small percentage of creators, it was fantastic. They had enough cash to pay their bills and become a full-time creator. But for the majority, definitely nowhere near enough to give up any day job.

Fast forward to February 2023 and the short-form video platform revamped its offering to become the Creativity Program Beta (though it has since been renamed the TikTok Creator Rewards Program). Call it a hybrid model between a creator fund and revenue share model; the program pays creators based on “dynamic revenue per mille (RPM)”. To participate, creators need to have 10,000 followers and 100,000 views in the last 30 days.

Where the jury is still out:

Meta

Previously, Instagram allowed creators to earn money through in-stream video ads, taking a 55% share of the revenue. However, this venture was cut back in February 2022 when Meta shifted focus to Reels. When Digiday last reported on this back in October 2022, Facebook was providing a 55% share of revenue to creators via in-stream ads and ads on Facebook Reels. However, even this particular model seems to have been revamped.

Right now, Meta is working on a Facebook Content Monetization program, which merges its three existing Facebook-funded monetization offerings: the in-stream ads and ads on Reels mentioned above, as well as Performance Bonus.

So far, little is known about how this will pan out or the intricate details of how it works as the program is still an invitation-only offering until sometime next year.

X

Back in July 2023, nine months after billionaire Elon Musk had bought then-Twitter, the controversial entrepreneur introduced a revenue share program for creators. Periodically, there’d be tidbits of information from creators themselves saying online what huge cash sums they were making from X — though 19 months later, still not much is known about the program, such as the revenue share split creators receive.

What we do know is that payouts are calculated based on “engagement from Premium users with your content on X” and those payouts are processed every two weeks, cashing out a minimum of $10 each time.

And as for creator eligibility, X states that those who can become part of the program must:

Have an active Premium or Verified Organization subscription

Have at least 5 million organic impressions within the last 3 months

Have at least 500 verified followers

Newer entrants to the creator monetization space

Reddit

In September 2024, Reddit introduced its Earnings Programs for contributors, developers and creators. The programs enable those individuals to earn cash for “eligible activities” on Reddit. The creator program specifically enables creators to sell collectible avatars to other users, or redditors.

While there are no details of how much a creator can earn, Reddit has shared eligibility requirements for those taking part in their programs:

A Reddit account that has been active for a minimum of 30 days and registered with a verified email address, and isn’t associated with an ad account.

Verified identity and a Stripe account.

Substack

Substack is a much newer entrant to the creator monetization game, having only recently announced its first creator fund. The newsletter subscription platform wants to encourage creators to move their paid-subscription audience over to Substack, so this pot of cash is reserved to help those creators so they don’t lose any earnings in the process. The $20 million fund is still very much a pilot program, given applications only opened on Jan. 23, and will be reviewed on a rolling basis throughout the year until all spots are filled.

While Substack hasn’t revealed the total number of spots available, or any other details about the pilot, the fund is currently only open to U.S. based creators (both individual or small groups) who earn a monthly recurring revenue of at least $2,000.

Spotify

A very new player to revenue sharing, Spotify, launched its Partner Program last month. While it’s still such a new product, the platform is very open about stating that creators that are part of it will earn a 50% cut of the revenue each time an ad plays in their episodes, both on and off Spotify.

So to be eligible to earn cash from podcasts, creators must (at the very minimum):",0.997,0.019,0.9,0.081

Logos have long been the cornerstone of brand identity, serving as a visual shorthand for a company’s values, personality, and mission.

Traditionally, logos were designed for print—on business cards, billboards, and packaging. But today, the digital landscape demands something more dynamic. This is why 3D logos and motion branding are considered the next evolution in identity design.

According to a survey, 62% of businesses now use some form of animated logo in their branding identity.

As brands compete for attention in an increasingly digital world, static logos are giving way to animated, interactive, and three-dimensional designs. These new branding elements move, transform, and engage audiences in ways that traditional logos simply cannot.

But what’s driving this shift, and how can businesses and designers harness this trend effectively?

In this article, we’ll explore the rise of motion-based branding, the benefits of 3D logos, and best practices for creating logos that stand out in the digital age.

Why Are Brands Moving Toward 3D and Motion Logos?

This new shift toward motion branding is being driven by several factors:

1. The Dominance of Digital Platforms

Social media, websites, and mobile apps have become the primary touchpoints for brands. Since motion-based content consistently outperforms static visuals, brands are adapting their logos to be more engaging, interactive, and memorable in these spaces.

A survey has found that including an animated logo in an email can boost click-through rates by an average of 18%.

Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and even LinkedIn prioritize motion-based content, making animated logos a smart choice for visibility.

2. Increased Brand Recognition and Memorability

Studies show that animated visuals are more memorable than static images. Motion branding gives logos a unique personality, helping consumers instantly recognize a brand across multiple channels.

For example, think about the Netflix logo animation—the short “N” transition sequence has become instantly recognizable, reinforcing brand identity every time it appears.

3. A More Modern, Tech-Savvy Image

3D and animated logos signal innovation and adaptability. Brands that adopt motion branding appear more forward-thinking and tech-savvy, making them more appealing to younger, digitally native audiences.

Tech companies, fintech startups, and media brands are leading the way, using dynamic branding to convey a sense of innovation.

4. Versatility Across Different Platforms

A static logo may look great on a website header, but it doesn’t always translate well to video intros, mobile apps, or interactive platforms.

A motion-based logo can adapt to different formats:

A short looping animation for social media

A fully interactive version for apps and websites

A simplified static version for print branding

This flexibility makes branding more cohesive across multiple digital touchpoints.

How Brands Are Using 3D and Motion Logos

From subtle micro-animations to full-scale 3D transformations, brands are getting creative with motion branding. Here are some of the key ways businesses are incorporating movement into their logos.

Logo Transformations

Many brands are designing logos that morph between different states. These transformations help convey ideas like progress, connectivity, or fluidity.

Examples:

Google’s “G” logo animation, which smoothly transforms into different shapes when loading.

Uber’s motion logo, which subtly animates to emphasize movement and connectivity.

Interactive Motion Branding

Some brands are making logos reactive to user interactions. On websites and apps, motion branding can respond to scrolling, hovering, or clicking.

Examples:

Apple’s website icons, which subtly shift when hovered over.

Spotify’s animated logo, which reacts to music beats.

3D Logo Effects

With advancements in real-time rendering, brands are embracing 3D logos that feel more tangible. These logos rotate, scale, and light up, making branding more immersive.

Examples:

Meta (formerly Facebook) introduced a 3D logo with depth and dynamic light reflections.

Esports brands are using high-impact 3D logos that feel cinematic and energetic.

Best Practices for Creating 3D and Motion Logos

As exciting as motion branding is, not every animation or 3D effect works well. Here are some best practices to ensure your motion or 3D logo remains effective, scalable, and brand-appropriate.

1. Keep It Simple

Motion should enhance the brand identity, not overpower it. Avoid overly complex animations that make the logo feel distracting or gimmicky.

A simple, elegant motion—like a fade-in, rotation, or color shift—adds impact without overwhelming the viewer.

2. Optimize for Digital Performance

Motion logos need to be lightweight and fast-loading. If a logo animation takes too long to appear, it could hurt website performance and user experience.

Use vector-based animation formats (such as SVG or Lottie) for smooth playback.

Keep file sizes small for faster website and mobile app loading.

Ensure animations work seamlessly across devices and resolutions.

3. Prioritize Brand Consistency

The motion should match the brand’s personality. A luxury brand might use slow, smooth animations, while a tech startup could have snappy, energetic transitions.

Consistency matters across all brand elements—if your motion logo feels out of sync with your website, app, or marketing visuals, it could create brand confusion.

4. Make It Adaptable

A great motion logo works in multiple formats and sizes.

Ensure your logo animation:

Has a short, looping version for social media.

Has a longer, more detailed animation for video content.

Can easily convert to a static format for print materials.

5. Test for Accessibility

Not all users respond well to motion. Some may have motion sensitivity or prefer a more static experience.

Offer options for users to disable excessive animations on websites or apps.

The Future of Branding is Motion-First Design

As digital experiences become more immersive and interactive, brands will continue shifting toward motion-first design strategies.

3D logos and motion branding are more than just a passing trend—they represent the next evolution of digital identity design.

With brands competing for attention in fast-moving digital spaces, motion-based logos create stronger engagement, memorability, and adaptability.",0.9995,0.009,0.831,0.16
"META Platforms, Facebook.",Meta Apologizes for Recommending Violent Content to Instagram Users,"Meta has apologized after violent videos showing people being killed or badly injured were recommended to Instagram users yesterday (Wednesday).
[Read More]",https://petapixel.com/2025/02/27/meta-apologizes-for-recommending-violent-content-to-instagram-users/,2025-02-27,"Meta has apologized after violent videos showing people being killed or badly injured were recommended to Instagram users yesterday (Wednesday).

The videos were being pushed under the Reels tab with users reporting they saw footage of people being shot to death and run over by vehicles. The Wall Street Journal reports that one of their journalists saw people being mangled by machines. The accounts’ names included “BlackPeopleBeingHurt,” “ShockingTragedies”, and “PeopleDyingHub.”

Some of the videos received millions of views but Instagram has declined to reveal the full scale of the issue. “We have fixed an error that caused some users to see content in their Instagram Reels feed that should not have been recommended,” an Instagram spokesman says. “We apologize for the mistake.”

Users reported seeing gory content even with Instagram’s “Sensitive Content Control” set to its highest moderation setting. While most violent videos depicting extreme violence is barred on the Meta platform, some graphic content is allowed if it raises awareness about important issues like human rights abuses or armed conflicts. Such content will be given warning labels.

Meta denied that the influx of NSFW content has anything to do with its recent decision to get rid of content moderators and replace them with an X-style Community Notes system.

Back in January, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that he intends to dial back the sensitive content filters across Instagram, Facebook, and Threads, therefore reducing the amount of censorship. Zuckerberg acknowledged that the new policy means the company will “catch less bad stuff”, but the trade-off is that it will also “reduce the number of innocent people’s posts and accounts that we accidentally take down.”

The switchup in moderation policies were widely seen as an attempt to curry favor with new President Donald Trump who was previously kicked off Meta platforms in the wake of the January 6 riots.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",Why Did Instagram Reels Start Recommending a Ton of Violent and Graphic Content?,"Meta only said an ""error"" caused Reels to recommend violent and graphic videos, including videos depicting real shootings.",https://gizmodo.com/why-did-instagram-reels-start-recommending-a-ton-of-violent-and-graphic-content-2000569304,2025-02-27,"Meta says that a flood of violent and graphic Reels content recommended to Instagram users was an error that has now been resolved. Reels is Instagram’s take on short-form video that is hoping to become a viable competitor to TikTok as that app remains under threat of a U.S. ban.

“We have fixed an error that caused some users to see content in their Instagram Reels feed that should not have been recommended. We apologize for the mistake,” Meta said in a statement to the Wall Street Journal.

The apology comes a day after users on social networks including X started reporting that their Reels feeds were suddenly showing a large number of violent videos. The videos typically display a full-screen content warning and require the user to consent to viewing them before they can be played (counterintuitively, that warning probably makes people more curious to see what is behind the curtain). The Journal in its report described some of the recommended content:

A Wall Street Journal reporter’s account featured scores of videos of people being shot, mangled by machinery, and ejected from theme park rides, often back to back. The videos originated on pages that the reporter didn’t follow with names such as “BlackPeopleBeingHurt,” “ShockingTragedies” and “PeopleDyingHub.”

So many people were seeing the influx that the phenomenon quickly became something of a meme:

I've seen reels on Instagram you people wouldn't believe, cartel emptying full magazines on some man, a person blindfolded being beaten to death, woman giving birth in a pool, a woman sat on fire on street, all those reels will be lost in time, like tears in rain. pic.twitter.com/dWABCc3yqA — Rashed (@Lipsofashes) February 26, 2025

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced wide-scale changes to the company’s moderation policies shortly before President Trump took office, in an act seen as a move to appease the new administration. Those included, among other things, replacing fact-checking with a system reminiscent to X’s Community Notes; removing only the most high-risk content, like direct threats of violence; and dropping automated scanning of most prohibited content in favor of letting users report potential violations manually, because Zuckerberg said its automated systems made too many mistakes.

Conservatives have long alleged unfair censorship by social media platforms, even as conservative-leaning content often ranks the most popular on Facebook in particular.

While Zuckerberg has received much criticism over the new moderation policies—especially as many noted the new policy allows users to call homosexuality a mental illness— the crucial thing to note here is that Meta did not drop moderation entirely. Under its new policies, the company says it will still remove content that is particularly violent, such as “videos depicting dismemberment, visible innards or charred bodies,” as well as “sadistic remarks towards imagery depicting the suffering of humans and animals.” It does allow some violent content to remain if it is deemed educational or informative.

Meta, in its new statement, did not explain why the violent content suddenly appeared in so many users’ feeds. But the company is constantly tweaking its algorithms, particularly to maximize engagement, and it has been well documented that people are enamored by death, true crime, and other visceral content. A morbid curiosity draws people to want to understand and learn about death and how they might avoid ending up in dangerous situations themselves.

It is possible that Meta’s recent loosening of its moderation policies inadvertently allowed the violent imagery to be promoted (it is unclear if Meta’s automated flagging still applies to violent content). The Journal noted, “View counts on some of the promoted videos suggested that Instagram’s recommendations had massively boosted their viewership, with view counts on them often exceeding that of the accounts’ other posts by millions of views.” Signals that social networks traditionally use to identify engaging content include how long people continue watching them before skipping to the next video and how many times they are shared with friends. Shocking, outrageous content has long performed well online for this very reason (some may remember the shock site Bestgore.com): It garners engagement.

Another recent story is illustrative of how people are enamored by dark content, even if it leaves them feeling bad or anxious. 404 Media documented how an anonymous YouTuber took advantage of AI image and text generation to pump their channel full of fake “true crime” stories, exploiting people’s interest in such lurid content to make some easy cash. One of the videos from the channel, which was taken down by YouTube, was titled “Coach Gives Cheerleader HIV after Secret Affair, Leading to Pregnancy.” 404 reported that many of the millions of viewers who watched the channel believed the videos were real.

Social networks demote violent content for many reasons, including because it can often be illegal, be used to intimidate and scare, and, of course, because it is not advertiser-friendly. Meta’s “free speech” pivot has its limits, as demonstrated here. It is still turning the dials in the ways it sees fit. Perhaps that is why President Trump’s new administration is still showing signs of skepticism towards the industry.",-0.994,0.132,0.779,0.089

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A Canadian regulator said on Wednesday it will impose a fee on Google to recover the cost of enforcing a law that requires large internet platforms to pay for news content on their websites.

The imposition of the levy on the Mountain View, California-based search engine giant comes at a time of increased tension between Canada and the United States over trade, border security, and a digital services tax on U.S. technology firms.

The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission said the vast majority of its operations are funded by fees charged to the companies it regulates, and the cost recovery rule for the Online News Act will come into effect from April 1. The charge may vary from year to year and does not have an upper limit.

The CRTC finalized the rule after a period of public consultations, during which Google intervened to argue against its implementation saying it was ""not a rational approach"" to impose 100% of the costs on one entity.

Part of a global trend to make internet giants pay for news, Canada passed the law last year to address media industry concerns that tech companies were elbowing news businesses out of the online advertising market.

Only Alphabet's Google and Facebook-parent Meta met the threshold of a large enough company that would need to pay news organizations.

Google, after months of negotiations with the government, agreed to pay C$100 million annually in a deal with publishers to keep news stories in search results. Meta, however, decided to block news from its Facebook and Instagram platforms in Canada to avoid payments.

Google, among other comments in its submission to the CRTC, argued the rule was ""an unfair additional regulatory burden on a company that has continued to support the news ecosystem in this country.""

In a policy notice posted to its website on Wednesday, the CRTC said due to the structure of the Online News Act, the recovery costs can only be levied on the digital platforms to which the law applies.

Google declined to comment beyond its response submitted during the CRTC consultation.

Meta apologized for an ""error"" after Instagram users reported a flood of graphic and disturbing content recommended on their feeds.

""We have fixed an error that caused some users to see content in their Instagram Reels feed that should not have been recommended,"" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider on Wednesday.

Instagram users worldwide reported seeing a flood of short-form videos showing gore and violence, including killings and cartel violence, on Wednesday. These videos were marked with the ""sensitive content"" label but were being recommended to users back-to-back.

Meta, which owns Facebook , Instagram , and Threads , says it removes ""particularly violent or graphic"" content and adds warning levels to others. It also restricts users under 18 from viewing such content.

In the first week of January, Meta replaced third-party fact-checkers on its US platforms with a community notes flagging model.

The company also planned to ""simplify"" its content policies, said Joel Kaplan, the chief global-affairs officer, at the time. Meta would ""get rid of a bunch of restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are just out of touch with mainstream discourse.""

In January, Business Insider reported that the tech giant would officially end its US fact-checking partnerships in March.

Meta has faced a string of controversies since 2016 over lapses in content moderation. It has faced criticism for, among other issues, its role in illicit drug sales. Last year, founder Mark Zuckerberg joined other tech CEOs for a Congressional grilling about safety measures for children online.

Internationally, Meta's lack of content moderation and reliance on third-party civil society groups to report misinformation have been found to play a role in proliferating violence in Myanmar, Iraq, and Ethiopia.

"META Platforms, Facebook.","As Big Tech battles EU regulators, it also flaunts its value",The ad industry attempts to underline the economic contribution to regulators as growth rates start to plateau.,http://digiday.com/media-buying/as-big-tech-battles-eu-regulators-it-also-flaunts-its-value/,2025-02-26,"Away from headlines discussing the fissures between government and Big Tech, particularly those with a trans-Atlantic bent, representatives of the digital ad industry are attempting to woo policymakers by underlining their economic impact on the region.

Google is poised to face fresh charges, this time for breaching the EU’s Digital Markets Act. The news comes hot on the heels of antitrust authorities in Germany investigating Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. Both investigations’ primary concern is whether Apple and Google’s policies favor their own technologies over those of third parties.

In Germany, authorities have asked if Apple’s ATT treats third-party data differently from its own, granting itself advantages in the ad market while enforcing stricter restrictions on competitors. Meanwhile, the pan-European investigation will reportedly probe if it favors its vertical search engines, such as Google Shopping, Google Flights, and Google Hotels, over rivals.

In both cases, regulators argue that this differential treatment negatively impacts competition, potentially violating antitrust principles. These are just the latest in a long list of — see below for a summary of the key proceedings in the region — with authorities in the region also investigating other adland giants such as Amazon and Meta via parallel investigations in the region.

1. Alphabet (Google)

Digital Markets Act investigation

The European Commission is investigating Google for potential breaches of the DMA, focusing on whether Google unfairly prioritizes its own services, such as Google Shopping, over competitors.

U.K. Competition and Markets Authority investigation: The CMA has launched an inquiry into Google’s dominance in online search and its impact on consumers and businesses, including its ad tech practices.

2. Amazon

Preferential treatment investigation: The European Commission is examining whether Amazon’s use of non-public data from independent sellers on its platform gives it an unfair advantage in its retail operations.

3. Apple

App Store policies investigation: The EU is investigating Apple’s App Store practices, particularly concerning the mandatory use of Apple’s in-app payment system and restrictions on developers’ ability to inform users about alternative purchasing options.

4. Meta (Facebook)

Marketplace practices investigation: The European Commission fined Meta nearly €800 million ($837 million) in November 2024 for anti-competitive practices related to its Marketplace service, alleging that Meta tied its online classified ads service to its dominant social network, disadvantaging competitors.

These investigations and cases are part of the EU’s broader efforts to enforce the DMA and ensure fair competition in the digital advertising sector.

Some wonder if the current tensions between governments’ insistence on citizens’ privacy while pushing open market conditions to competition/technological innovation and the growing domination of Big Tech will result in a “splinterweb.”

In the “splinterweb” scenario, The European experience of the web — primarily, the ability for ad tech companies (including Big Tech entities) to monetize — is impeded. IAB Europe’s top economist, Daniel Knapp, notes how the term “splinterweb” first arose in “social theory critiques of the capitalist internet” and how it is increasingly becoming realized as Big Tech players — the few companies with the required scale to navigate nuanced global laws — start to dominate.

“All of this is moving into a world of controlling more and more closed pipes,” he said, speaking with Digiday in December 2024, describing the splinterweb as less interoperable but more profitable. “That’s one of the major trends we’re seeing at the moment.”

In what many have interpreted as a bid to win over some of Europe’s most influential policymakers, IAB Europe hosted a one-day conference earlier this month at the heart of pan-European political power, dubbed Advertising Horizons, in Brussels, Belgium.

Here, speakers from the leading advertising companies — notable among them were representatives of Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and TikTok — demonstrate the economic contribution of digital advertising, particularly the value it can provide to representatives’ own constituency.



One source, who requested anonymity in return for candor, noted the perceptions IAB Europe members are trying to counter, adding that many in the industry are even setting aside their day-to-day commercial rivalries. “There’s a lot of different stakeholders, with publishers, platforms, and tech providers,” they said, adding that many were trying to work out the common denominator.

The source went on to add, “One of the things is that Brussels sees digital advertising like the tobacco industry … so traditional policy interventions don’t tend to work there.”

In an earlier December 2024 presentation entitled “State of the Nation,” which examined the dynamics of the European digital advertising market, IAB Europe’s Knapp noted how growth in the region is expected to be “stable, yet underwhelming.”



However, he also noted a “pessimistic outlook” when it comes to growth rates in Europe’s largest advertising markets, with digital ad spend across Europe expected to grow 6.1% in 2025; this is compared to 10% a year earlier.

In fact, further observation notes how increases in CTV and retail media budgets are shoring up an overall plateau in digital ad spend, with the “media apocalypse” unevenly distributed between legacy publishers and the “indieverse” (many of whom rely on the internet’s largest platforms).

Knapp further noted that 79.1% of digital ad spend in the region takes place in markets where GDP growth is forecast to be less than 2% this year. Even in the ad tech subsector, where the internet’s largest platforms faced the most competition throughout the 2010s, spending is concentrating even further.

Knapp further cited figures from Jounce Media, observing that 80% of open web demand goes through five companies: Google, Meta, Amazon, The Trade Desk, and Criteo. He noted that this is a sign that market players “require fewer, deeper partnerships.”

An examination of the forecasted spending patterns for two of the ad agency holding groups, GroupM and Dentsu, demonstrates how AI will play a role in this narrative. The former claims 94% of ad revenue will be informed by AI by 2027, while the latter claims 70% will be “algorithmically enabled” during the same period.

However, as AI is becoming intrinsically linked with media buyers’ strategies, it does raise the question of which entities control said decisioning engines. This is especially pertinent as “closed-loop systems,” such as Meta’s Advantage+, Google’s PMax, and TikTok’s Smart+, etc., dictate spending patterns by informing media teams where to attribute value.",0.9966,0.012,0.905,0.083
"META Platforms, Facebook.",Meta Must Face Lawsuit Claiming it Prefers Cheaper Foreign Workers,A federal judge on Tuesday said Meta Platforms must face a lawsuit claiming that the Facebook and Instagram parent prefers to hire foreign workers because it can pay them less than American workers. U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San …,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2025/02/26/813331.htm,2025-02-26,"A federal judge on Tuesday said Meta Platforms must face a lawsuit claiming that the Facebook and Instagram parent prefers to hire foreign workers because it can pay them less than American workers.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco said three U.S. citizens who accused Meta of refusing to hire them though they were qualified may pursue a proposed class action.

Meta and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The plaintiffs – information technology worker Purushothaman Rajaram and software engineer Ekta Bhatia, both naturalized U.S. citizens, and data scientist Qun Wang – said they each applied for several Meta jobs between 2020 and 2024, but were turned down because of Meta’s “systematic preference” for visa holders.

Meta, based in Menlo Park, California, said there was no proof it intended to discriminate, or would have hired the plaintiffs if they were not U.S. citizens.

Related: EEOC Says It’s Going After ‘Anti-American Bias’ in the Workplace

But the judge cited statistics that 15% of Meta’s U.S. workforce holds H-1B visas, which typically go to foreign professionals, compared with 0.5% of the overall workforce.

She also cited Meta’s October 2021 agreement to pay up to $14.25 million, including a civil fine, to settle federal government claims it routinely refused to consider American workers for jobs it reserved for temporary visa holders.

“These allegations support the plaintiffs’ overall complaint that they were not hired because Meta favors H-1B visa holders,” Beeler wrote.

The government had sued Meta in December 2020, seven weeks before President Donald Trump ended his first White House term.

“We are hopeful that the lawsuit will help remedy the favoritism towards visa workers that is common in the tech industry,” Daniel Low, a lawyer for the three plaintiffs, said in an email. “Fully addressing the issue will require additional enforcement or legislative reform.”

Beeler had dismissed an earlier version of the lawsuit, which named only Rajaram as a plaintiff, in November 2022.

A divided federal appeals court revived the case last June, saying a Civil War-era law barring discrimination in contracts based on “alienage” protected U.S. citizens from bias.

Many conservative groups have cited that law, Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, in challenging diversity initiatives in the workplace, which Trump also opposes.

The case is Rajaram et al v Meta Platforms Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-02920.

"META Platforms, Facebook.",How to Leak Under the Trump Administration,"Want to expose wrongdoing in the U.S. government? Take these steps to keep yourself safe.
The post How to Leak Under the Trump Administration appeared first on The Intercept.",https://theintercept.com/2025/02/26/how-to-leak-whistleblower-trump/,2025-02-26,"President Donald Trump doesn’t have fond feelings for whistleblowers.

During his first term, Trump’s Justice Department carried out a clandestine spying operation to try to catch leakers. On the campaign trail, Trump on multiple occasions threatened to arrest journalists who don’t reveal their sources — and suggested they should be raped in prison until they give up names.

For those who want to speak out against wrongdoing within the U.S. government, it has never been more critical to take steps to keep themselves safe. So we compiled these best practices for leaking information in public interest under the Trump administration.

Don’t Call or Text

Phone calls and text messages are convenient, but they aren’t safe for whistleblowers. As outlined in a December report from the Office of the Inspector General, the Justice Department in Trump’s first term repeatedly utilized “compulsory processes” — which include subpoenas, search warrants, and court orders — to request “non-content communications records” from phone carriers serving journalists at CNN, the New York Times, and the Washington Post. The requests were for both the reporters’ work numbers and their personal numbers.

Non-content records don’t include the communications themselves — such as copies of text messages or voicemails. Instead, government investigators were keen to gather metadata pertaining to the communications: for instance, who sent a message or made a call to a journalist’s phone and at what time.

Even if the contents of the conversation are not recorded, the metadata establishes clear links between parties.

If a metadata search turns up evidence of communication with journalists or rights groups, this alone could reveal who is behind a leak.

Don’t Email

Never use a work or personal email address when communicating with journalists.

In its attempt to root out leaks during Trump’s first term, the Justice Department also sought non-content information pertaining to reporters’ email communications from their email service providers. They wanted details such as the time an email was sent and received, as well as the sender’s email address.

While email encryption technology can encrypt the body of the email message and in some cases subject lines as well, the email addresses themselves and dates and times emails are sent and received are not encrypted.

This means it’s not hard for investigators to use email records to draw a clear line between a journalist and their source — even if they can’t determine what information specifically was exchanged.

Setting up a separate email account entirely for communicating with journalists or rights groups is an option, but there are a number of potential gotchas. For instance, care should be taken to not reveal any identifying information when setting up a burner email account: Don’t use your phone number for two-factor authentication, choose a throwaway username that is not linked to you in any way, and select a vetted VPN or the Tor network to mask your IP address. Considering all these obstacles, it’s often best to avoid email altogether.

Don’t Reach Out on Social Media

The owners of tech’s biggest social media platforms have shown varying degrees of fealty to the Trump administration. These genuflections include Mark Zuckerberg ending DEI programs at Meta, Andy Yen, the CEO of “privacy-first” email provider Proton, going on about how the Republican party today stands for “the little guys,” and Elon Musk, the owner of X, calling shots as a “special government employee.”

The fact that Trump’s richest fan also owns a popular social media platform should give pause about using X to share sensitive information. It doesn’t take an overactive imagination to see a scenario in which the companies that own communication channels are willing to provide user information to a government they’re eager to please.

Although social media direct messages are generally unencrypted by default, some social media platforms now offer optional end-to-end encrypted messaging, though this feature needs to be enabled manually. For instance, X direct messages can be encrypted if both parties are verified users, and Facebook Messenger can also be used to send encrypted DMs. But the metadata, or non-content information, would still reveal that your account was in contact with a reporter’s account.

Similar metadata risks apply to messaging platforms such as Telegram and WhatsApp. Telegram offers encryption, but it is not enabled by default and comes with a number of limitations. WhatsApp encrypts messages by default, but nonetheless reveals a variety of metadata about communications themselves.

Given the way government investigators typically demand non-content communication records, end-to-end encryption alone does not mask whether or not someone is talking to journalists or other entities.

Secure communication tools such as Signal and Session minimize the amount of metadata and user information that platform operators themselves can access.

Signal can identify the date a particular account was created, as well as when the account last accessed the service. It can also identify a phone number associated with an active username, which is vastly less metadata than other messaging platforms collect.

If you’re concerned about your username being linked to your phone number, change your username at regular intervals, which would prevent past usernames from being tied to your phone number.

Signal routinely posts copies of the requests for user information it receives from the government. These disclosures show that Signal tends to share merely when a particular account was last accessed and first created. Government requests for information from service providers, however, may come with non-disclosure orders that could legally prevent operators from posting notice of these demands on their transparency pages and potentially bar them from notifying the affected users themselves.

Session, a messenger whose tagline is “send messages, not metadata” reduces the amount of information it stores about its users by, for instance, not using centralized servers to relay messages.

Nothing Is a Substitute for OPSEC

But the best end-to-end encryption and metadata minimization won’t keep you safe without basic operational security.

Digital access logs may reveal who viewed, printed, or downloaded a copy of the file, and when. The more files you access, the more likely it is that you may be the one common individual who accessed all those files.

Avoid whistleblower communications while physically present at work. Aside from someone seeing your screen, your employer may also be able to identify that you accessed a particular communication service while on a company network.

Under no circumstances should you also use work devices when communicating with or transferring data to reporters or rights groups.

Equally risky are personal devices with any work-assigned device management apps installed. It might seem old-fashioned, but rather than taking a screenshot of a specific document or chat record on a work device, take a photo of the screen with a separate one-time use phone, or at least a personal device.

Make clear to anyone you might alert of wrongdoing that leaked photos or documents generally should not be published in their entirety. That’s because source material can potentially be linked to the specific device with which it was captured.

A photo showing a file on your computer monitor, for instance, might include a blemish or a smudge of dirt on the screen. More sophisticated forensic techniques, such as watermarking, can be used to trace the origins of a leaked email or video conference.

Even emails seemingly sent to a large number of recipients may be individually watermarked, with each message containing some unique change that can be traced to a single recipient. That’s why it’s safest for journalists not to reproduce emails verbatim and instead rely on selective quotes or summarizations.

After communicating with outside parties, ensure that no records of sensitive communications persist. Be sure to delete not just specific messages, but entire chat histories from all linked devices on which your messaging app of choice is installed. Request that anyone with whom you share sensitive information does the same. Remember to not save each other in your contacts lists, either.

Blowing the whistle can have a real impact in the world, but it also comes with risks — the threat of prosecution or losing your job among them. Although leak investigations may again become a priority in the Trump administration, these dos and don’ts can help reduce the chances of exposing yourself when you’re shining light on wrongdoing.",0.9972,0.049,0.848,0.102
