His coverage areas include audio (Sonos, Apple, Bose, Sony, etc.), home theater, smartphones, photography, and more.

Apple is bringing higher-fidelity audio to its AirPods Max headphones in April, the company announced today. When the $549 headphones switched to a USB-C connector last year, they lost support for wired audio playback — but Apple is about to rectify that with full lossless support, which even the prior Lightning model technically lacked.

“With the included USB-C cable, users can enjoy the highest-quality audio across music, movies, and games, while music creators can experience significant enhancements to songwriting, beat making, production, and mixing,” the company wrote in a press release on Monday. “With this update, AirPods Max will unlock 24-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio, preserving the integrity of original recordings and allowing listeners to experience music the way the artist created it in the studio.” Lossless support “extends to Personalized Spatial Audio,” Apple noted.

Aside from richer sound, the new update enables ultra low latency on the AirPods Max, which makes them better suited for music production, gaming, and live streaming purposes, according to the company.

The firmware update will roll out alongside iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 sometime in April. You can use a USB-C to USB-C cord for lossless audio, but Apple is also now selling a $39 USB-C to 3.5mm audio cable that shares the same braided design as its other recent cables.

The previous edition of the AirPods Max with a Lightning connector don’t offer true “lossless” playback because of a signal conversion that occurs whenever a wired audio source is used. It’s still better quality than you’d get listening over Bluetooth, however.",0.9904,0.013,0.854,0.133

The Apple-1 was the first computer sold by Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, and so few remain that they fetch high prices at auction.



The Apple-1 that sold is known as the ""Bayville"" Apple-1, and it is number 91 on the Apple-1 Registry. The Apple-1 Registry aggregates all known remaining Apple-1 computers, and it includes details and a history for each one. The registry has 104 Apple-1 machines listed.

The Bayville Apple-1 was part of the first batch of Apple-1 machines sold in 1976, and it has a handwritten serial number that was likely penned by Steve Jobs. It was sold with an original manual with a handwritten note by Daniel Kottke, who was Apple employee number 12.

The Apple-1 was sold alongside many other Apple-related items as part of a ""Steve Jobs and the Apple Revolution"" auction event. A 1976 Apple Computer check signed by Steve Jobs sold for $112,054, and a sealed, first-generation 4GB iPhone sold for $87,514.

I guarantee they’re either divided into separate guides for iOS and Android, like The Verge’s, or include categories like “Best for iPhone owners” or “Best for Android.” (Also, like The Verge’s fitness tracker guide.) It wasn’t always this way.

Five years ago, you could buy a Samsung or Fossil smartwatch and use it with an iPhone. The problem was it was never quite as good. Apple Watches were superior, not only because they could seamlessly connect with your Mac and AirPods, but you could also send quick replies to texts. Other third-party smartwatches couldn’t do all that.

Losing the ability to interact with other devices was hardly a deal breaker — it’s not that hard to go through the regular Bluetooth pairing process. But most people view smartwatches as an easy way to stay connected without glancing at their phones. Losing quick replies because you might prefer the look or features of a third-party device? For many people, it’s a tradeoff that doesn’t make sense. For years, I’d ask device makers why this feature wasn’t available. Every single time, from companies large and small, the answer was that Apple didn’t allow it. So, I was hardly surprised when Android smartwatch makers started kissing iOS goodbye in 2021 with Wear OS 3. In the years since, the number of platform-agnostic wearable makers continues to dwindle.

This is a big reason why it’s a good thing that the European Commission recently gave Apple marching orders to open up iOS interoperability to other gadget makers. You can read our explainer on the nitty gritty of what this means, but the gist is that it’s going to be harder for Apple to gatekeep iOS features to its own products. Specific to smartwatches, Apple will have to allow third-party smartwatch makers to display and interact with iOS notifications. I’m certain Garmin fans worldwide, who have long complained about the inability to send quick replies on iOS, erupted in cheers.

Apple, and at least one tech publication, has decried this decision as hindering Apple’s ability to innovate. In a statement, Apple spokesperson Marni Goldberg told The Verge that it will force the company to “give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules.”

But the last few years have been fairly lackluster for smartwatch innovation. Samsung blatantly copied Apple in its 2024 smartwatch lineup with the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch FE. Google has mostly stuck to refining the Pixel Watch. Apple introduced an Ultra model in 2022, but otherwise, last year’s Series 10 was another iterative update. The Ultra 2 only got a new color. (Even though that color was sick as hell.) In the wearables world, smartwatches are kind of… just there.

These days, I receive far more queries about smart rings and smart glasses — because everyone knows that if you have an iPhone, you get an Apple Watch, and if you have an Android, you get a Galaxy Watch or a Pixel Watch. (Maybe a OnePlus Watch 2 or 3 if you really care about battery.) If you’re an endurance athlete, you get a Garmin. There’s not much incentive for any of these companies to zhuzh up designs or think out of the box when ecosystem lock-in all but ensures they don’t have to. There’s no urgency. The result is smartwatches have become boring as we wait for the next Big Health Feature to get FDA clearance. I long for the weird, frenetic excitement of 2014-2020 era smartwatches. Instead, I have a hard time believing 2025 smartwatches will be much different from last year’s. (For the record, I would love to be proven wrong.)

Fans of walled gardens have to admit it doesn’t always work out. The Powerbeats Pro 2 ought to be a cautionary tale of how the “it just works” philosophy can backfire. Despite being an Apple product, Android users actually have more choice when it comes to how they use the Pro 2. On iOS, the heart rate feature is limited to seven apps and users must choose between monitoring heart rate or listening to tunes when connected to gym equipment. Android users have no such limitations. Do the Powerbeats Pro 2 work more seamlessly on the iOS apps it does support? Yes. But that’s not important to everyone. Some people just want the ability to choose how they use the products they buy.

The bottom line is the EU’s move improves a consumer’s ability to pick the best smartwatch for their needs regardless of their phone. There’s no reason a grizzled marathoner who prizes in-depth training metrics, free coaching plans, and monthlong battery life should have to get an Apple Watch Ultra over a Garmin just because they also want to have quick replies. I’ll admit that it is mind-numbingly convenient and pleasant to stay in one ecosystem. But if the Apple Watch is truly the best smartwatch out there, it should be able to defend that title even if third parties have access to iOS notifications.",0.9985,0.057,0.787,0.156

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.

Apple TV Plus is losing more than $1 billion every year despite reaching 45 million subscribers in 2024, according to a report from The Information. It’s reportedly the only Apple subscription that isn’t generating a profit.

As part of an effort to take “a harder line on spending,” Apple cut its initial $5 billion budget for Apple TV Plus content by around $500 million, The Information reports. Even with hit original shows like Severance, Apple TV currently captures less than 1 percent of total monthly streaming services viewership, as opposed to Netflix’s 8.2 percent, according to data from Nielsen cited by The Information.

But, as noted by The Information, Apple TV Plus was largely created to keep people in the Apple ecosystem. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos touched on the strategy behind Apple TV Plus during an interview with Variety this week, saying “I don’t understand it beyond a marketing play, but they’re really smart people. Maybe they see something we don’t,” he said.

Apple TV Plus is part of the company’s broader services business, which makes Apple billions of dollars each year through iCloud Plus, App Store purchases, and search advertising. Sources also told The Information that Apple Music, which reportedly reached 100 million users on subscriptions and free trials last year, has seen a slowdown in growth.

Apple News Plus, Fitness Plus, and Apple Arcade also “struggle with low usage and profits,” while sales of digital books have taken a dip as well, The Information reports. Sources tell the outlet that if these services weren’t included in the company’s Apple One bundle, which people mostly buy for iCloud Plus, they “likely wouldn’t be profitable.” Apple reportedly laid off around 100 people in its News and Books division last year.

Since joining in 2021, her work has won ASME design and American Illustration awards.

When asked what they do for work, creative couple Jessie Char and Maxwell Neely-Cohen should probably just say “yes.” True professional multihyphenates, Char’s gig history includes stints as a UI/UX designer, conference organizer, concert cellist, and Apple Genius; Neely-Cohen is a novelist, ballet dancer, and coeditor of the experimental literary journal The HTML Review. Together, they’ve built everything from a real-life version of Cher Horowitz’s Clueless closet to the sound design of a play with over 200 original sound cues.

I asked them for a tour of the tech in their Williamsburg, Brooklyn, loft, where they regularly host literary salons, violin performances, and film industry mixers. We chatted about their shared reverence for old hardware, live coding, how they find comedy in sound, and why they’ll never install a smart light switch.

Max selects a record from the couple’s well-organized vinyl collection using a pair of multisided dice. The couple developed a game where house rules dictate whatever record is pulled must be played from start to finish.

A de Sede DS-600 movable couch is the main furniture piece of the sitting area in their Williamsburg loft.

How did you two meet?

Max Neely-Cohen: It was at a Zoom reading group at the very beginning of the pandemic. We were reading Expanded Cinema [by Gene Youngblood] with a group of mostly designers and artists.

Jessie Char: The book was about the early history of computer art and animation.

And then what? Someone slid into the other’s DMs?

MNC: First we stayed long on the Zoom call—

JC: Until everybody peeled off and then it was just us. So, we hung out on Zoom for a few hours, and then I slid into his DMs on Instagram right after.

MNC: I mean, she beat me by seconds.

JC: But there is another cute thing, which is the Color Chat app.

MNC: It’s this really cool art project where you could only communicate with each other by sending color swatches. You would select from this big rainbow wheel, and then it would send it and it would name the color. And I would send a lot of unintentionally flirty colors. I swear to God, I sent one that was “lipstick red” and then another that was just “passionate fire.” But it was also accurate. So, we would kind of joke about it, but it was also extremely real flirting.

The first-floor bathroom’s tunes are played via an iPod connected to 2004 Harman Kardon SoundSticks speakers.

And then Jessie, who was living in San Francisco, moved to New York?

JC: The first time I visited Max was November of 2020, and I was supposed to stay for a couple of weeks, but there was another covid wave, so I didn’t want to fly. And basically, I just stayed forever.

What were you both up to creatively at the time?

JC: I was in the middle of losing my career. I used to produce a design conference that took place at the same time as Apple’s developer conference, WWDC. It was the kind of little sister conference of WWDC. And [when covid hit], obviously conferences stopped happening. So I was kind of floating through life trying to figure out what to do next. [I was] still doing design contract work, but I had kind of lost my big thing. I was still freelancing, but it wasn’t anything fun. I actually can’t remember the first creative thing that I did when I came to New York.

MNC: It was live coding.

Tell me about that.

MNC: It’s this still-emerging practice where you can perform music, visual art, all sorts of things, through writing code and executing it onstage. If you really think about it, all music involves manipulating machines that the audience mostly doesn’t know and understand. Like, I don’t know how a saxophone works. So this is a similar thing, where you’re basically up there with these custom-made languages that make everything faster, performing music with the code you’re writing.

A mechanical keyboard fan. Max has an array of keyboard caps. On a shelf in the kitchen is a painting of their cat, Detective Blueberry, by Jessie, who is also a wonderful cook. The couple enjoy hosting gatherings, often with friends and collaborators.

How did you both learn to code?

JC: In the GeoCities days, pre-Neopets HTML, is what we’re talking about. As an adult, even though I was living in the Bay Area and working in tech, I never actually coded for work or fun really. It was just this thing that I knew how to do from when I was a kid.

MNC: I didn’t ever code for any other reason than that I wanted to make a weird thing, and then it evolved to learning how to do weird projection art, and I just needed to learn different things for very specific projects.

JC: And I was making Spice Girls fan pages [as a kid].

MNC: Live code was kind of my first foray back into learning a new coding language. Kind of remembering that I have this framework for how to program things.

Which coding language?

MNC: ORCA.

Like the whale?

MNC: Like the whale.

JC: And I really wanted to impress Max. So I learned a programming language to impress him—

MNC: She learned it within days.

Max’s collection of synthesizers. An homage to Nam June Paik’s “TV Garden” sits under the stairs at the edge of the living room. Images on the CRT TVs are responsive to the sounds created at the console to its left.

How did you transition from live coding to working as sound designers in theater?

JC: The writers strike.

MNC: Yeah, because of all the strikes. We didn’t know what would happen with the directors guild at that point. A lot of our friends, who were mostly working in TV and film but were trained in theater, started getting jazzed about theater projects because [the writers strike didn’t affect theater]. So our dear friend Maia [Novi] came to us and said, “I have a play. I want you all to sound design it.”

JC: She was like, “You’re both good at computers and music.” And we had no idea [what sound design was]. We were like, “Yeah, we’ll get some bug sound effects and play them on a laptop.” We had no idea how the process worked, what the software was, but we kind of figured it all out on the job and really fooled everybody into believing in our competence. Since that first run of Invasive Species, where we had no idea what we were doing, we’ve basically been working in theater nonstop for the past two years.

So how did you approach the sound for Invasive Species? What did that process actually look like?

JC: I think that Max and I have the tendency to take things to their absolute furthest ends when we have the means to do it. So instead of it just being the sound effect of a bug flying around, it turned into basically a fully scored play where we wrote an underscore for the whole thing.

What’s an underscore?

MNC: Just music that plays underneath the play. It isn’t just one-hit sound effects, like a door slamming or whatever. It’s music that the actors would kind of choreograph themselves to and work with, and [it requires] sophisticated queuing setups, which is kind of a form of programming in QLab.

How long did it take you to write?

MNC: Two weeks.

You wrote the whole score of a show in two weeks? Is that normal?

JC: Theater is normally pretty fast, but we didn’t know any better. And I think, realistically, a typical sound designer probably does about 1/20th of what we ended up putting out because we just didn’t know what the world expected of this. We just went really, really hard.

How are you assembling the sound that gets included? Are you making music? Are you sampling?

MNC: Yeah, all of it. We were mostly making music through every way available to us. This is a little different from Jessie, but my most successful things as a theatrical sound designer have been the things I’ve made as jokes that then end up in the show.

A homemade cardboard tank for Detective Blueberry. Detective Blueberry fan art.

Does it feel funny in the show or does it feel like it’s a joke that only you get?

MNC: No, it’s not that it’s a joke in the show. It’s just that, in whatever rehearsal and then tech process, I’m like, “Wouldn’t it be funny if I made this?” And at that moment, I don’t know if it’s actually going to be good, right?

JC: But there is a lot of comedy in the sound. I think that we do have a sense for how to infuse a very specific type of comedy into the sound design. It’s not like it’s a rubber chicken and spring boingy sounds; it’s not cartoonish in any way. But I think that the sound design is able to capture a lot more of the writing and storytelling.

So you’re doing a lot of theater work together. Are you collaborating in other ways?

JC: I want to say yes, but I have to think of what collaborations are. Aside from our entire lives together.

Jessie and Max worked with Automatic Audio in Montreal to customize their sound system.

Let’s talk about your individual creative interests. Max, you have two highly specific titles on your resume: a fellow at the Harvard Law School Library Innovation Lab and a consulting dramaturge at the New York Choreographic Institute at the New York City Ballet. You should probably start by telling me what a dramaturge is.

MNC: It’s a great question. A dramaturge in dance, opera, or theater is a person who helps develop the themes and narrative qualities of the piece, kind of across departments. Particularly in dance or opera, there isn’t the same relationship between director and writer. There are all these departments making all this art, and it can be really helpful to have someone who’s almost taking on the mantle of: What is the audience going to see? What are they going to take from this, and how does that affect the story and its structure?

Tell me about your approach to technology in your home.

JC: We are really specific about it, aren’t we?

MNC: Yeah. We hate any smart home things. We banned them.

Many of Max and Jessie’s retro gaming devices are still in working order. A Tetris power user, Jessie has her Game Boy models and the original Tetris game cartridge in the couple’s vintage collection.

What do you dislike about smart home tech?

JC: I think that with the rise of the internet and Wi-Fi, a lot of companies that make software rely on the fact that they can just keep releasing updates. And I don’t want to have to do a software update on my light switches or my refrigerator. I just really like things that are guaranteed to work and are fixable because I know how to do hardware repairs — I have certifications for it — and I like knowing that if something isn’t working properly, I can personally address the issue. But so many smart home devices are proprietary; they are inaccessible, and that worries me a little bit.

MNC: Yeah, we were not going to buy toilets that we could not fix ourselves.

JC: Because toilets are technology!

MNC: Likewise, the speakers we have, we wanted to make sure that we could always open them up and solder the wires back together. Which is not true of a Bose soundbar.

JC: I just see technology as a really wonderful tool. I don’t see it as an assistant, and I think that’s the kind of distinction that I like making. Anything that I can use as a tool, I absolutely love, and anything that’s trying to help me in some way isn’t as useful to me.

An homage to Nam June Paik’s “TV Garden” sits under the stairs at the edge of the living room. Images on the CRT TVs are responsive to the sounds created at the console to its left.

Tell me about your TV garden and your synthesizer library.

MNC: It was an evolution that began in the last apartment we lived in, which started before we met when I wanted to put all the instruments I owned on one rack. So, the first version was actually a beat-up dish drying rack from a supermarket that got discarded. The setup we have now is driven by this principle of being able to flip one switch and everything turns on. We can use it for professional stuff, but an eight-year-old kid can also start making sound with it right away.

It’s a place for play.

MNC: It’s a place for play. And the TVs were a way for us to have this little visual synthesizer in a fun way. Given the space under the stairs, we didn’t want it to just be a bunch of televisions on the floor, so we designed it as an homage to Nam June Paik’s “TV Garden.”

Apple,"Ditch Your Apple Watch, The Galaxy Watch Ultra Is Now 50% Off on Samsung’s Store",Nothing to trade in? Samsung's also offering $230 of instant credit and phenomenal deals on accessories when you buy the brand-new Galaxy Watch Ultra.,https://gizmodo.com/ditch-your-apple-watch-the-galaxy-watch-ultra-is-now-50-off-on-samsungs-store-2000578493,2025-03-20,"When Samsung dropped the Galaxy Watch Ultra last July, it was instantly compared to the Apple Watch Ultra 2 which had come out several months earlier. In fact, we compared them directly, and basically ruled this clash of flagship smartwatches to be a draw in terms of quality and performance. But when Samsung decides to make the Galaxy Watch Ultra available for as little as $325 with trade-in credit or $420 without (down from $649), suddenly the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is looking very pricey indeed.

See at Samsung.com

If you’re able to max out the trade-in credit from Samsung and get the full $325 they’re offering, the Galaxy Watch Ultra comes in at less than half the price of the Apple Watch Ultra 2, basically making the choice for you. Even without a trade-in, the $230 in instant savings currently offered by Samsung makes the Galaxy Watch Ultra more affordable than the Apple Watch Ultra 2 by over $350. Either way, Samsung’s further sweetening the pot with great discounts on accessories, like 61% off a pair of Galaxy Buds3 or 41% off the Galaxy Buds3 Pro.

It Loves a Workout

Samsung has packed the Galaxy Watch Ultra with advanced fitness-tracking technology so it can go toe-to-toe with the vaunted Health app of the Apple Watch lineup. The Galaxy AI-powered heart-rate monitor eliminates inaccuracies caused by motion, providing exceptionally precise readings. The Galaxy Watch Ultra also delivers VO2 Max measurements, estimated sweat loss, and performance tracking for runners and cyclists, allowing you to compare previous workouts and gauge improvements over time.

This is the watch for you if you’re a hardcore adventurer and/or watersports enthusiast, because it can take anything dished out by your active lifestyle. The titanium case of the Galaxy Watch Ultra is ultra-durable, and engineered to keep up with your toughest workouts. With 10 atmospheres of water resistance, it’s ideal for swimmers, divers, and kayakers, while hikers and climbers will appreciate enhanced GPS tracking and turn-by-turn navigation that ensures you never lose your way.

See at Samsung.com

The Numbers Don’t Lie

You won’t have to worry about the Galaxy Watch Ultra’s battery running out at inopportune times — it has the longest battery life of any Samsung smartwatch to date. That means after it tracks your toughest workout, you’ll be ready for bed and the Galaxy Watch Ultra will still be up and running to monitor your sleep quality.

Unless you have extreme brand loyalty to the Apple Watch or other fitness-oriented wearable, the option to buy Samsung’s newest flagship smartwatch for well under half the price of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 when you max out the $325 trade-in credit offer is hard to pass up on, especially when you consider they are basically neck-and-neck in terms of performance. Even with no trade in, the $420 price with instant credit makes the Galaxy Watch Ultra the clear choice.

Apple,8 TV Shows and Movies to Watch After You Finish Severance,"Hopefully it won't be another long gap between seasons for the Apple TV+ series, but you're definitely going to have some time to fill.",https://gizmodo.com/what-to-watch-if-you-like-severance-streaming-2000577595,2025-03-19,"The Severance season two finale is this week, making this both a thrilling and devastating moment for its devoted fans. Finally, some answers (maybe?) about all those lingering mysteries! But also, the end of our weekly supply of Lumon-induced drama, romance, freakiness, and quirky comedy, until such time as a yet-to-be-confirmed third season arrives! To help your tempers recalibrate when Severance wraps up, here are eight TV shows and movies that might help fill the yawning void it will leave behind.

Dark Matter

You don’t even have to exit the Apple TV+ app for Dark Matter. It’s based on Blake Crouch’s book about a man who unwittingly dives into the ultimate “what if?” scenario when he’s kidnapped by a different version of himself, then forced into an unfamiliar version of his life’s timeline. Like Severance, it explores themes of how wildly divergent personalities can evolve from a single person—and involves weird tech that seems like a pretty cool invention until the horrible consequences start making themselves known. Joel Edgerton is less endearing of a hero than Severance‘s Adam Scott, but you’ll still want to root for him to reunite with his beloved, played by Jennifer Connelly. The first season is available for streaming now; a second season is on the way.

Devs

Do you long for more workplace weirdness after all those Lumon elevator rides? Devs, created, written, and directed by Alex Garland (who’s best-known for his big-screen credits: Ex Machina, Annihilation, Civil War, the upcoming 28 Years Later) takes place at a mysterious tech company with sci-fi leanings (much like Severance) and involves a murder mystery (also much like Severance). It also has the Severance-like quality of boasting a killer cast, including Nick Offerman, Sonoya Mizuno, Cailee Spaeny, Alison Pill, and others. You can watch its eight-episode single season on Hulu.

Black Mirror

Quite obviously, Black Mirror and Severance have some thematic echoes, chief among them that tech can be scary—especially if its inventor or wielder has cult-like aspirations and/or fancies themselves to be a god. Just as Severance season two began to wrap up, Netflix announced the star-studded seventh season of Charlie Brooker’s dystopian standard-bearer will drop April 10. You can also stream the previous six Black Mirror seasons in case you want to experience something bleaker than our current reality in the meantime.

Westworld

At this point, it’s less and less likely we’ll ever get that fifth season Westworld‘s creators have teased in the past. But really, the four seasons we did get remain some of sci-fi television’s finest hours, exploring a world where robots are so lifelike their AI slips into the realm of the fully sentient—with the added bonus of imaginative settings (a Wild West playground for rich people, a futuristic city where humans have fallen under robot control) and an incredible cast, including Evan Rachel Wood, Jeffrey Wright, and Thandiwe Newton. The only thing we can fault Westworld for isn’t the doing of the show itself; HBO yanked it from streaming a few years back, so you’ll have to fork out extra dollars to rent or buy it on streaming (Prime Video has it), or purchase the complete series on Blu-ray, DVD, or 4K UHD.

Fingernails

Jessie Buckley, Jeremy Allen White, Luke Wilson, and Riz Ahmed star in this offbeat sci-fi romance—made for Apple TV+—set in a world where technology has supposedly cracked the formula of true love. Adding to the Severance factor, it’s actually set within the awkward confines of the Love Institute, the company that administers the test. When Buckley’s character takes a job there, she soon begins to question her own relationship, as well as whether or not the Love Institute is actually helping or hurting people.

Coherence

A group of friends and frenemies gather for a dinner party the night a comet just happens to be passing through the night sky—and reality jumbles as a result, with versions of the guests wandering in from different parallel realities. It’s a gripping sci-fi thriller that proves you don’t need a big budget or even more than one set, really, to tell an entertainingly original story, and it’s also perfect viewing for anyone who found themselves second-guessing Severance‘s Helena/Helly R. twist. Coherence is widely available on streaming, including Peacock and Prime Video.

The One I Love

Doppelgangers—the classic physically separate kind, unlike Severance‘s one body/multiple minds variety—complicate this tale of a couple (Mark Duplass, Elisabeth Moss) whose attempt to mend their relationship with a romantic getaway takes a very surreal twist. Ted Danson, who makes everything better, plays their therapist. Streaming free with ads on Prime Video.

Bliss

Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek star in this Prime Video feature from Mike Cahill (Another Earth, I Origins) that puts a romantic spin on a classic sci-fi plot: what if everything you think is real is just a simulation? Bliss also offers a thoughtful exploration of what it means to appreciate what you have in life—while also learning to accept the grimier stuff you’d rather just delete with the ease of a keystroke. Streaming on Prime Video.

Honorable mention: Made for Love

This sci-fi series that ran on what was then HBO Max in 2021-2022 starred Cristin Milioti (The Penguin, Black Mirror) as a woman whose attempts to escape her dysfunctional marriage to an eccentric tech billionaire (Billy Magnussem) are complicated by the fact that she has a chip designed to spy on every aspect of her life, including her emotions, implanted in her brain. Made for Love was delightfully original and would absolutely fit in with a Severance-adjacent streaming binge, except it’s no longer available on Max— and is in fact not streaming legally anywhere. It also, frustratingly, never got a physical media release.",0.9991,0.065,0.758,0.176

Apple fixed a bug in the iOS 18.2 Passwords app that, for three months starting with the release of iOS 18, made users vulnerable to phishing attacks, according to an Apple security content update spotted by 9to5Mac.

Here’s how Apple describes the bug and its fix:

Impact: A user in a privileged network position may be able to leak sensitive information Description: This issue was addressed by using HTTPS when sending information over the network.

As 9to5Mac writes, the Passwords app was sending unencrypted requests for the logos and icons it shows next to the sites your stored passwords are associated with. The lack of encryption meant an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network as you, like at an airport or coffee shop, could redirect your browser to a look-a-like phishing site to steal your login credentials. It was first discovered by security researchers at app developer Mysk.

In the description of the below YouTube video demonstrating the bug, Mysk writes that it first reported the vulnerability in September. Apple describes the same bug in security content updates for the Mac, iPad, and the Vision Pro, as well.",0.0516,0.078,0.84,0.083

Jim Jordan, the Republican Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, upped his investigations into Big Tech by sending subpoenas to 16 major tech companies, asking whether the federal government had pressured them into using artificial intelligence to “censor lawful speech” – a new front in his long-running quest to prove the tech industry is out to silence conservatives.

Citing a report filed last December, in which the committee found several alleged examples of Biden officials “pressuring private companies to ‘advance equity,’ stop ‘algorithmic discrimination,’ and ‘mitigate the production of harmful and biased outputs,’” Jordan demanded they produce any and all emails with a third party, government or otherwise, between January 2020 and January 2025, “referring or relating to the moderation, deletion, suppression, restriction, or reduced circulation of the content, input, or output of an AI model, training dataset, algorithm, system, or product.”

The subpoenas are the latest move in the GOP’s long-running and innumerable investigations into whether tech companies were suppressing right-wing ideology on their platforms, and narrowed in on potential interference from the Biden administration over the past several years. But this inquiry is particularly vast: its broad request for any document that ever discussed AI content restrictions over the past five years, as well as its targeting of software companies that are not media platforms, such as Adobe, Nvidia and Palantir, represents the party’s escalation against the industry.",0.2382,0.032,0.941,0.027
Apple,All the Severance Questions We Still Have Ahead of the Season Finale,Season two has been illuminating so far—but there are still plenty of Lumon mysteries waiting to be solved on the Apple TV+ hit.,https://gizmodo.com/all-the-severance-questions-we-still-have-ahead-of-the-season-finale-2000575838,2025-03-14,"Oh, how innocent we were at the end of January, only three episodes into the second season of Severance. We didn’t even know what Salt’s Neck was, or where Ms. Casey’s been tucked away! We may have a slightly better idea of what the hell is going on as Apple TV+’s sci-fi sensation/internet obsession heads into its season two finale next week—but there are still secrets galore lurking in Lumon’s hallways.

With that in mind, it’s time to revisit io9’s earlier post running through our most burning Severance questions and see where they now stand—and you know we’ve got plenty of new ones, too.

First, here’s a rundown of our early-season questions—some of which we’ve since learned the answers to.

Where is Ms. Casey?

In episode seven, “Chikhai Bardo,” we got a detailed backstory of Gemma (later known as Ms. Casey) and Mark’s relationship, from their first meet-cute at a blood drive, to their blissful early days of marriage, to their devastating struggles with infertility. We also learned that Gemma has been literally beneath Mark’s feet the entire time; with a variety of severed personalities activated depending on which room she enters, she’s been undergoing a series of highly unpleasant experiences on Lumon’s testing floor, which is even more underground than the severed floor.

How did Gemma become Ms. Casey—and why?

We don’t have precise details yet on either of these, though we do have some more clues to go on. We know that Gemma and Mark visited a fertility clinic run by Lumon, and that Gemma remained in contact with the place, or at least received follow-up mail (the “Chikhai Bardo” card came with some sort of personality test) associated with it. We also saw the night she left alone for an event that Mark did not want to attend and never came home, with a pair of police showing up to deliver the sad (fake) news of her fate.

While we don’t know exactly how she became Ms. Casey—was she kidnapped? A willing participant until realizing what she’d actually agreed to?—we have a slightly less foggy idea of why. Based on episode seven, we know she’s being held against her will, and that Mark’s work as a “Macrodata Refiner” has shaped her experiences on the testing floor. We also know based on this week’s episode, “The After Hours,” that when Mark finishes his most important work file, the all-important Cold Harbor, Gemma’s life will end.

We don’t know, of course, any of the big-picture stuff, like what exactly Lumon plans to do with the results of this barbaric experiment, and what future implications it may have.

What is Cold Harbor?

See above. We have no idea what’s actually waiting for Gemma in the room, but it’s going to be way more awful than being on a plane that’s seemingly about to crash, a painful afternoon at the dentist, or a passive-aggressive Christmas spent writing inane thank-you notes. After “Chikhai Bardo,” it seemed plausible Cold Harbor would be where Gemma would re-experience her miscarriage over and over, but now that we know it’s designed to be fatal—could it be a car crash that actually kills her?

What is Ms. Cobel’s plan and what’s in Salt’s Neck?

Thanks to episode eight, “Sweet Vitriol,” a lot of Ms. Cobel’s backstory has been fleshed out. We know she grew up in a Lumon company town that’s now nearly deserted, and that most everyone who still lives there is—thanks to Lumon—an ether addict. We learned Cobel’s mother, who was one of those ether addicts while she was alive, hated Lumon. We also learned Cobel was a gifted student who earned the prestigious Wintertide Fellowship, and that Jame Eagan stole her designs for the severance procedure and passed the invention off as his own.

That all certainly explains a lot of her behavior until now: her eerie devotion to the cult of Kier, something she’s been entangled with her entire life; her creepy interest in Mark both inside and out of work (since his completion of Cold Harbor is somehow tied into the success of severance), her extreme reaction when she was fired from Lumon, and (as we saw in “The After Hours”) her apparent decision to help Mark and Devon right as Gemma’s time is running out.

Where is Kier, PE?

Still no idea. But it’s not just snowy roads: you can take a train far, far away if you need to escape Kier, like Irving does in “The After Hours.”

Who’s on “the board”?

Still no idea. The only Eagans we’ve met are Jame and Helena. Could there be more?

What is the deal with Natalie?

Again, no idea. If the season finale reveals Natalie is an innie whose outie is the complete opposite of “PR person with a death-ray smile,” it wouldn’t be entirely surprising.

Why does Lumon want Ricken to re-write his book for innies?

Yet again, we don’t know, other than perhaps it was a way for Lumon to keep its hooks in Mark’s family—since we now know exactly how valuable he is to the company. Ricken hasn’t been seen much in season two, though his portrayal in the “Chikhai Bardo” flashback suggests his overly mannered personality used to be a lot more charming. The episode was all about Mark and Gemma, but it also showed the audience that Devon and Ricken’s relationship isn’t as mismatched as it appears to be in the show’s present day.

Why is Miss Huang a kid?

This we now know: like Ms. Cobel before her, little Eustace is a Wintertide Fellow. She and Mr. Milchick never worked very well together, but he did allow her to graduate. In “The After Hours,” we see her being sent away from the Lumon office (and her parents, it’s pointedly mentioned) for a new posting in Svalbard, probably one of few places on Earth that’s colder than Kier.

Why did Helly lie about her “Overtime Contingency” experience?

We learned the answer to that in episode four, “Woe’s Hollow.” It wasn’t Helly in that scene, it was the duplicitous Helena Eagan. She was faking that she was her innie in order to spy on MDR.

Who is outie Irv talking to on pay phones?

We don’t know, and we may never know, since “The After Hours” saw Irv and his dog board that train out of Kier, courtesy of Burt, with explicit instructions never to return. The best guess is that he was somehow tied into the anti-severance movement, and was speaking to a contact that probably helped him compile that list of names and addresses of severed workers (including Burt).

What’s up with the Exports Hall?

We knew it led to the testing floor, since we saw Ms. Casey walking down that long hallway at the end of season one; in season two, it’s where Dr. Mauer wheels his dental tools, and Ms. Casey’s would-be escape route when she tries to find her way out of captivity in “Chikhai Bardo.” But we don’t know why it was haunting Irving’s thoughts, so much so that his outie painted images of it over and over. With help from Felicia in Optics and Design, Irv’s innie left behind some very convoluted directions to find its entrance, which Helly R. gets ahold of after Dylan—the intended recipient—impulsively quits MDR in “The After Hours.”

How will Mark’s reintegration go?

It hasn’t been smooth sailing, with sudden nosebleeds, the persistent couch, what appeared to be a seizure followed by a brief lapse into a coma, and some confusing consciousness blips. The only medical professional who knows his secret, Reghabi, took herself out of the equation when Devon decided to phone Ms. Cobel. So that’s not very reassuring.

Are the Macrodata Refiners actually doing anything?

While the details aren’t entirely clear, we know their work sorting “scary numbers” and completing files named for places (Allentown… Cold Harbor) has some kind of impact on the testing floor.

THE GOATS

We haven’t seen a goat since episode three, “Who Is Alive?”—unless you count production-design details like the goat statue on the altar belonging to Ms. Cobel’s Kier-devoted aunt, seen in “Sweet Vitriol.” The goat represents malice, one of the four tempers mentioned as having been “tamed” by Kier Eagan as part of his extensive lore. As to what practical purpose the goats in Lumon serve, and why the employees who take care of them are so oddball, we don’t yet have an answer.

Now, let’s dig into the newest questions currently keeping Severance fans up at night, especially now that there’s just one episode left to go.

What plan will Cobel, Mark, and Devon come up with?

When last we saw this unlikely trio, they’d gathered in one of the severance-rigged cabins at the “birthing retreat”—great idea from Devon, by the way—so that Cobel could talk to Mark’s innie. Mark and Devon want to rescue Gemma from her Cold Harbor fate, and Cobel has some serious explaining to do, both to the Scout siblings and to the very curious audience. So what will their next move be? As we’ve seen, you can’t exactly barge your way onto Lumon’s severed floor… much less infiltrate the testing floor below. But as we’ve also seen, Lumon’s security can be surprisingly porous sometimes—like when the innies pulled off the overtime contingency mission in season one, for instance.

And speaking of that birthing retreat scene… WTF?

We’ll be haunted by Ms. Cobel’s description of Devon (pretending to be a Lumon employee) as a woman needing discreet entry into the birthing retreat because “she’s one of Jame’s.” What does that mean, exactly? One of Jame’s what? Willing or unwilling vessels for his Eagan seed? You can’t just let that twist in the wind, Severance!

Will Mr. Milchick continue to rebel against Mr. Drummond specifically and maybe Lumon at large?

Mr. Milchick standing up to Mr. Drummond, correctly pointing out that whatever Mark does when he’s not at work isn’t something he can control—true for any job, but especially since Mark is severed and becomes a completely different person when he steps off that elevator and goes home—was an unexpectedly delightful moment in “The After Hours.” It’s felt like Mr. Milchick is on the brink of breaking from his good-soldier routine for a few episodes now (his reaction to the paintings, his performance review ordeal). Could he become an unexpected innie ally as the season draws to a close?

Is this the last we’ve seen of Dylan, Irving, and Burt?

It’s pretty clear Miss Huang has departed for good—but what about these other characters? All had what could be final send-offs in “The After Hours.” You have to hope we’ll at least see what happens to Dylan and his outie’s wife, Gretchen, and maybe learn if Burt will face consequences for seemingly breaking Lumon farewell protocol with Irving.

Will Mark have to choose between Gemma and Helly R.?

It would be a love triangle… except one of the points is two different men contained in a single body. Mark S. loves Helly R. and Mark loves Gemma. No matter what, someone is going to get their heart broken—as we saw with Dylan’s agonizing storyline in “The After Hours.” How will he choose? Or will the decision be made for him, maybe to the point that nobody ends up happy? Will Gemma die in the Cold Harbor room? Will the sinister Helena Eagan triumph in permanently erasing her much, much cooler innie?

And speaking of Helly R… why is Jame Eagan creeping on MDR?

Who does he think he’s confronting in one of the final scenes in “The After Hours”—his daughter, or her innie, who he considers to be less than human? Why does he want Helena to eat her breakfast eggs raw rather than hard-boiled?

No answers. Only questions here.

That brings us to the inevitable biggest questions of all. How will Severance set up season three—will fans be left dangling on another cliffhanger like the end of season one?

And by the way, when will Apple TV+ confirm season three is on the way? And how long will we have to wait to see more?

The GSM Association announced that the latest RCS standard includes E2EE based on the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol, enabling interoperable encryption between different platform providers for the first time.

The GSM Association said it had started working to enable E2EE on messages sent between Android and iPhone in September last year. E2EE is a privacy and security feature that prevents third parties, such as messaging providers or cell carriers, from viewing the content of your texts. The GSMA says the new RCS standard was developed in collaboration with “mobile operators, device manufacturers, and technology providers,” including Apple.

“End-to-end encryption is a powerful privacy and security technology that iMessage has supported since the beginning, and now we are pleased to have helped lead a cross industry effort to bring end-to-end encryption to the RCS Universal Profile published by the GSMA,” said Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer. “We will add support for end-to-end encrypted RCS messages to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS in future software updates.”

Apple introduced RCS support to iPhones as part of an iOS 18 update in September. While Apple’s proprietary iMessage system already supported E2EE, this wasn’t extended to RCS messaging because the previous RCS standard didn’t provide cross-platform support. Google Messages also enabled E2EE by default for RCS texts, but only conversations between Google Messages users were E2EE, and not those exchanged with iMessage users or users of other RCS clients on Android.

“We’ve always been committed to providing a secure messaging experience, and Google Messages users have had end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messaging for years,” Google spokesperson Ed Fernandez told The Verge. “We’re excited to have this updated specification from GSMA and work as quickly as possible with the mobile ecosystem to implement and extend this important user protection to cross-platform RCS messaging.”

That would be Siri, which Apple said last year it had turned from a quasi-helpful voice assistant into an AI-powered helper that could understand everything about you and accomplish things on your behalf. Sounds cool, right? It was one of the flagship features of the iPhone 16 lineup, a big part of the way Apple promoted its new devices. Except it doesn’t exist. And it won’t anytime soon.

On this episode of The Vergecast, we talk about exactly where things went wrong with Siri — and with the whole gadget industry, which became so enraptured with the promise of AI that it sort of forgot to make good gadgets. Nilay and David discuss the problems and promise with Alexa, the still-enticing ideas behind “ambient computing,” and what it’ll take for Apple to make things right. (Side note: if you haven’t read John Gruber’s essay on the subject at Daring Fireball, you should — we recorded this episode before it published, but it’s an excellent summary of the situation.)

After that, The Verge’s Andy Hawkins joins the show to talk about the state of Tesla. As Elon Musk continues to try and tear down the federal government, his electric car company has become a uniquely politicized thing – there’s just no other way to explain the car show put on by President Trump on the White House lawn this week. Tesla’s rise has in so many ways enabled Musk’s own, and it appears man and company are more closely tied than ever. That might be a problem for the car company.

Apple,All this bad AI is wrecking a whole generation of gadgets,"The onrushing AI era was supposed to create boom times for great gadgets.

Not long ago, analysts were predicting that Apple Intelligence would start a “supercycle” of smartphone upgrades, with tons of new AI features compelling people to buy them. Amazon and Google and others were explaining how their ecosystems of devices would make computing seamless, natural, and personal. Startups were flooding the market with ChatGPT-powered gadgets, so you’d never be out of touch. AI was going to make every gadget great, and every gadget was going to change to embrace the AI world.

This whole promise hinged on the idea that Siri, Alexa, Gemini, ChatGPT, and other chatbots had gotten so good, they’d change how we do everything. Typing and tapping would soon be passé, all replaced by multimodal, omnipresent AI helpers. You wouldn’t need to do things yourself; you’d just tell your assistant what you need, and it would tap into the whole world of apps and information to do it for you. Tech companies large and small have been betting on virtual assistants for more than a decade, to little avail. But this new generation of AI was going to change things.

There was just one problem with the whole theory: the tech still doesn’t work. Chatbots may be fun to talk to and an occasionally useful replacement for Google, but truly game-changing virtual assistants are nowhere close to ready. And without them, the gadget revolution we were promised has utterly failed to materialize.

In the meantime, the tech industry allowed itself to be so distracted by these shiny language models that it basically stopped trying to make otherwise good gadgets. Some companies have more or less stopped making new things altogether, waiting for AI to be good enough before it ships. Others have resorted to shipping more iterative, less interesting upgrades because they have run out of ideas other than “put AI in it.” That has made the post-ChatGPT product cycle bland and boring, in a moment that could otherwise have been incredibly exciting. AI isn’t good enough, and it’s dragging everything else down with it.

Apple is probably the worst and most obvious offender here. For nearly a year, ever since the company debuted Apple Intelligence at WWDC last June, it has pitched just about every one of its new products the same way: “it runs Apple Intelligence!” The iPhone 16 ads were less about the iPhone 16 and more about showing off what Apple Intelligence could do — never mind that Apple Intelligence didn’t even ship until months after the iPhone 16. When Apple upgraded the iPad Mini, then the iPad Air, it promoted Apple Intelligence as the reason for both. (The also-new base iPad doesn’t support Apple Intelligence, and so Apple has effectively tried to bury its existence.) The website for the new MacBook Air promotes three things about the bestselling laptop on earth: its battery life, its chip, and Apple Intelligence.

Meanwhile, Apple Intelligence is currently just a couple of writing tools and a way to poorly summarize your text messages. (And, sure, Genmoji.) The feature people actually want, the one Apple has been relentlessly promoting, is a vastly improved Siri that can better understand and execute your requests, even using your apps on your behalf. That feature is nowhere to be found and “is going to take us longer than we thought,” Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy recently told John Gruber at Daring Fireball. The company pulled a commercial with Bella Ramsey in it that advertised the iPhone 16 Pro using this now-even-further-delayed feature.

It’s hard not to feel bait and switched by the whole thing. For months, people have seen advertisements for features that don’t exist, bought gadgets that don’t work the way they’re supposed to, and been generally duped into thinking a tiny spec bump was a game-changing upgrade. At this point, of course, Apple is too committed to Apple Intelligence to walk it back, and investors would crush the company if it did.

Siri’s ongoing crappiness appears to also be the reason behind the delay of Apple’s next big product launch. We’ve been hearing for months about a smart home hub that would leverage Apple Intelligence — and, in particular, that better, more aware Siri — to control your house and accomplish tasks on your behalf. (Imagine Alexa, but Siri, and you basically have it.) Bloomberg reported that the device was supposed to launch as soon as this month but is being pushed back in part because the underlying tech just doesn’t work.

These kinds of context-aware, voice-enabled ambient computing devices were supposed to be what AI made possible. That’s why Amazon, too, allowed itself to be totally captured by AI long before AI was ready to be a useful consumer product. Amazon was once among the most interesting, experimental hardware makers on the market — remember that one year it launched like 6,000 Alexa devices in one day, including a microwave and a wall clock? Amazon wasn’t always right, but it was never dull. Amazon hasn’t released a meaningfully new Echo device since September 2023, the day the company also announced a new version of Alexa that then-hardware chief Dave Limp called “a superhuman assistant.” Since then, we’ve gotten old ideas on slightly larger screens, with the same problems Amazon has had for years.

Alexa Plus sounds great, but there are no new devices in this picture to run it. Image: Amazon

Amazon was all in on this new Alexa, betting that it could turn its smart speakers from a music and timers machine into something vastly more useful. You wouldn’t even necessarily need new hardware for it; your gadgets would just keep getting better. But then, of course, Amazon confronted the reality of the AI situation. It took nearly 18 months of work, and a lot of rumors and reports that suggested AI Alexa was actually pretty terrible, before the company launched pretty much the same thing all over again. Only this time, with new hardware chief Panos Panay doing the talking. And no devices to show. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy promised “beautiful” new hardware this fall but revealed no other details.

It’s not just big companies, either. For the last year or so, the hottest thing in startups has been “put a microphone on a lanyard, record your whole life, and use AI to do… something with it!” That’s the pitch for Friend, and Omi, and Limitless, and Plaud, and Bee, and so many others. Jony Ive and OpenAI are working on some kind of AI hardware together. Investors poured huge money into Humane, only to see that collapse less than a year after its first launch. Rabbit’s R1 was a flop. None of these devices have so far been compelling, and some of them just plain don’t work.

To be fair, product makers are in a tough spot right now. If you believe AI is a paradigm shift, that it will change the world the way smartphones or the internet did, you’d be foolish to wait around for the tech to be perfect. By then, it’ll be too late, and you’ll have lost the race.

Too many companies have made all their plans based on some theoretical and perfected end state of AI

The problem is that too many companies have made all their plans based on some theoretical and perfected end state of AI, rather than looking for ways to make it useful right now. There are already lots of ways AI can make products more useful and interesting: cutting-edge models can make your robot vacuum more efficient or help your video doorbell better distinguish between people and tree branches. AI can make your smart lights a lot smarter or figure out what you’re cooking and get the sear just right. In all these cases, though, AI is an enabling technology for some other feature — not the feature itself. Nobody’s buying a smart grill for the AI; they’re buying it for the steaks.

Maybe someday, “you can do AI with it” will be a selling point for gadgets. In the interim phase, it feels like we’re wasting an entire generation of hardware while we wait for the software to catch up. And there are so many other interesting problems to solve! What if, instead of hand-wavey promises about AI, we got smartphones that lasted twice as long or didn’t break so easily? What if startups focused less on AI and more on the millions of people looking for devices that are less addictive and more attuned to a specific purpose? What if Amazon and Apple stopped waiting for some magical technological overhaul and spent time making their existing devices easier to use?",0.9997,0.052,0.775,0.173
Apple,Moft’s new origami case elevates the iPad for improved ergonomics,Moft has announced a new folio-style cover case for iPads that could improve the tablet’s ergonomics for anyone working with the Apple Pencil or simply watching videos. The Moft Dynamic Folio uses an origami approach to transform into a stand that can elevate…,https://www.theverge.com/news/628261/moft-dynamic-folio-apple-ipad-tablet-case-folding-origami,2025-03-12,"is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.

Moft has announced a new folio-style cover case for iPads that could improve the tablet’s ergonomics for anyone working with the Apple Pencil or simply watching videos. The Moft Dynamic Folio uses an origami approach to transform into a stand that can elevate the tablet by up to three inches, while other configurations let you support a smartphone at the same time. The flexibility lets Moft’s case go above and beyond the limited folding functionality of Apple’s own Smart Folio iPad cases.

The company is making its new Dynamic Folio available to consumers through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign that has already surpassed its $10,000 funding goal. The case will be available in three sizes and support the iPad Mini as well as 11 and 13-inch versions of the iPad, Pro, and Air. Early backers can preorder the Mini case for $34, the 11-inch version for $45, or the 13-inch for $55, while full pricing is expected to be closer to $39, $49, and $69, respectively. Shipping is expected to start as early as May 2025.

Made from fiberglass covered in Moft’s own scratch-resistant vegan leather alternative called MOVAS, the largest version of the Dynamic Folio adds 292 grams of weight to an iPad, so it’s also lighter than Apple’s iPad cases. It attaches magnetically so you can easily pop it off when you want to use your iPad without a case, but its design doesn’t completely protect the tablet on all sides like many silicone cases do. When attached, the Dynamic Folio will help protect the screen and back of the iPad from scratches, but it leaves several sides exposed. If you happen to drop it, there’s a chance the iPad could still get dinged and dented depending how it lands.

The Dynamic Folio can elevate the iPad two-inches at a 30-degree angle, or up to three-inches at a higher 60-degree angle. Image: Moft

The primary use cases include two floating modes. One elevates the iPad two-inches at a lower 30-degree angle that’s useful for working, playing games, or browsing the web, while the other positions the iPad at a 60-degree angle three-inches above a desk or table for reading or watching videos.

The case offers other configurations, and can even be used to support an iPad on your leg when you can’t find a table. Image: Moft

Moft’s case can be folded in several other ways to support the tablet in portrait and landscape modes, to add an additional support for a smartphone, or to make it easier to balance the tablet on your knee when you don’t have access to a work surface. Moft also offers an optional Apple Pencil holder that magnetically attaches to the case and adds a bit more protection for the pricy stylus.",0.9976,0.017,0.825,0.158
Apple,"15-inch MacBook Air (M4, 2025) Review: Bluer and Better",The latest 15-inch MacBook Air is bluer and better than ever before—and it dropped in price.,https://www.wired.com/review/macbook-air-15-inch-2025/,2025-03-11,"Some have called it the perfect laptop. Others, including myself, have wondered who it’s for. I’m talking about the 15-inch MacBook Air, of course—the small yet large, powerful but fanless, middle-of-the-road MacBook. I always considered it a bit niche among the lineup of the best MacBooks, squeezing a narrow tier between the 13-inch MacBook Air and the 14-inch MacBook Pro.

But with the M4 model, the increase in performance and capabilities, paired with a lower price, make it feel like the 15-inch MacBook Air has finally come into its own.

A Blue MacBook!

The design of the MacBook Air hasn't changed since 2022, but people are still marveling at it. For those who haven't seen the 0.45-inch thickness in person–or are coming from a much older laptop–they’re still in for a treat. In the past three years since this design originally launched (or two years for the 15-inch model), no other laptop has come along to take its sleekness crown. It's still the thinnest laptop you can buy in its respective category.

For those who've seen this before, the only noticeable exterior change is the new Sky Blue color option. I've seen people call this underwhelming for how not-blue it is, but let's not forget how much flack Apple took for its bolder iMac colors a few years back. I prefer this subtler approach. It mostly resembles a light silver, but in the right natural light, it sparkles with a unique bluish hue. I do have to pour one out for Space Grey, which has now been completely replaced. It will always be my favorite laptop color, and I'm a bit perplexed as to why it's gone. RIP.

There haven’t been any changes to the 15.3-inch LED 60-Hz screen, the excellent keyboard and trackpad, or the overall shape and build quality of the device, so let's go over what else has changed.",0.9894,0.024,0.843,0.133
Apple,"The New Apple iPad Air Pre-Orders Just Got More Tempting, Amazon’s Already Slashing Prices",A pre-launch discount on an Apple product? The New iPad Air is already on sale!,https://gizmodo.com/the-new-apple-ipad-air-pre-orders-just-got-more-tempting-amazons-already-slashing-prices-2000574334,2025-03-11,"The new iPad Air is basically the Goldilocks of tablets – not too basic, not too pro, just right. With its M3 chip and gorgeous 11-inch screen, it’s powerful enough to replace your laptop but still super portable. Whether you’re editing photos, binging Netflix, or trying to look professional on Zoom calls, this thing handles it all without breaking a sweat. Plus, with features like Wi-Fi 6E and that crispy Liquid Retina display, it’s built to keep up with whatever you throw at it.

Even though it’s not officially out yet, Amazon has already knocked $40 off the price for pre-order, dropping it to $559 from $599. Sure, 7% off might not seem huge, but hey—any discount on a brand-new Apple product (especially before launch) is worth checking out!

See at Amazon

Your do everything, go everywhere tablet at a discount

The M3 chip is the real star here. This thing blazes through everything from heavy-duty video editing to graphics-intensive games without missing a beat. Battery life is solid too – you can work (or play) all day without hunting for a charger. It’s genuinely impressive how much power Apple packed into something this thin.

The 11-inch screen is a beauty, with all the fancy features you’d expect: super-accurate colors, True Tone to adjust to your lighting, and an anti-reflective coating that actually works. Whether you’re marking up documents or watching the latest show, everything looks crystal clear.

iPadOS makes this tablet seriously versatile. You can run multiple apps at once, hook up external displays, and even use it like a laptop with Stage Manager. The USB-C port means you can connect all sorts of accessories, and Wi-Fi 6E keeps everything running smooth and fast.

The cameras are no slouch either. The front-facing 12MP camera with Center Stage keeps you perfectly framed during video calls (even when you’re fidgeting), while the rear camera shoots great photos and 4K video. Touch ID in the power button makes unlocking and paying for stuff super quick.

While you’ll need to buy them separately, add-ons like the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard can transform this tablet into either a digital sketchbook or a proper laptop replacement. The new USB-C Apple Pencil is a cheaper option if you just want to take notes or doodle.

At $559, you’re getting a seriously capable device that could easily be your main computer. While it’s not the biggest price cut we’ve seen, it’s a solid deal on Apple’s latest and greatest mid-range tablet—especially considering how much versatility you’re getting in this sleek package.

Even better? This deal is happening before the iPad Air is even out. Amazon is already offering a 7% discount on pre-orders, knocking $40 off the price before it even hits shelves. Getting a discount on a brand-new Apple product before launch? That’s rare—so if you’re planning to buy, this might be the best time to lock in some savings.

Apple,"Apple MacBook Air (13-Inch, M4) Review: More Power For Less Money","This lightweight machine comes equipped with a bit more power and some necessary improvements, all for a more affordable price.",https://www.wired.com/review/macbook-air-13-inch-2025/,2025-03-11,"i've been devoted to the MacBook Air since 2012, when I bought my first one with money I saved up from a summer job before my first semester of college. (You can read more about that journey here.) As someone always working on the go, I've always been drawn to how lightweight it is. When Apple revamped it back in 2022 with a new design, bigger and brighter display, MagSafe support, and a 1080p webcam, I was thrilled—this was my dream MacBook come to life.

But as I said in last year's review, the 13-inch MacBook Air has reached its peak in terms of design. Apple continues to release the same model while mainly focusing on the internals—and the same logic applies to this latest version. The standout features are the M4 chip (the entry-level chip of the lineup) and double the base memory (also available on its predecessor). Apple did throw in an updated 12-megapixel webcam and a new blue color option, but aside from that, the chassis remains the same.

Typically, when a next-generation model lacks any major additions, Apple keeps the price the same as previous versions. This time, however, the price sees a welcome reduction to $999—$100 less than its predecessors. It's what the MacBook Air cost before the launch of the M2 model (Apple did sell the M2-powered MacBook Air for $999 once the M3 Air came out, but the M4 replaces both models). So, that means the highest configuration will cost $2,199.

Although there are still a few additional things I had on my wish list for this next-gen version (a nano-texture glass option being one of them), the MacBook Air with M4 continues to live up to its reputation as a reliable, lightweight machine and the best MacBook for most people. The fact that it's as affordable as it used to be is the cherry on top.

Subtle Alterations

As with previous generations, the 13-inch MacBook Air has a square chassis, a big and bright 13.6-inch LCD panel (complete with a 60-Hz refresh rate), a four-speaker sound system, and a three-mic array. Coming in at 2.7 pounds, it also remains super lightweight and comfortable to commute with. You'll also get the same port selection, which includes two USB 4/Thunderbolt ports, a MagSafe charging port, and a 3.5-mm headphone jack.

I fully understand that an extensive port selection is usually reserved for the MacBook Pro, but I truly wanted Apple to add at least one extra USB-C port here—especially since you can connect the MacBook Air to up to two external monitors (we'll get to that later). Instead, you'll have to use a chunky USB-C hub, which is just another accessory you'll have to buy (if you don't already have one) and carry around.",0.991,0.0,0.913,0.087

Apple,"Apple Mac Studio (M4 Max, 2025) Review: Small but Mighty","For creatives who need the very highest level of performance, the Mac Studio delivers it—and then some.",https://www.wired.com/review/apple-mac-studio-2025/,2025-03-11,"In her review of the 2023 edition of the Apple Mac Studio, Brenda Stolyar called the pint-sized powerhouse “the Goldilocks Mac”—suggesting its combination of performance and price was just about perfect for power users, at least those that don’t need the hemorrhage-level bleeding-edge performance of the Mac Pro tower.

Today Apple aims to maintain that verdict, upgrading the device to keep up with the times and again releasing the Studio in two versions, one of which should be ideal for any creative.

The 2025 Mac Studio can be configured either with the new M4 Max CPU or with the M3 Ultra. It may sound counterintuitive, but the M3 Ultra version is the more premium of the two SKUs, by a significant margin; the Ultra design family has been described as merging two Max CPUs that the computer addresses as a single chip. There’s no M4 Ultra CPU yet, so ultra power users get the equivalent of a pair of M3 Max CPUs instead. This isn’t a consolation prize. Most head-to-head benchmarks place the M4 Max as only slightly faster than the 2023-released M2 Ultra, with the M3 Ultra significantly ahead from there. For the moment, Apple bills the new Mac Studio as “the most powerful Mac ever made.”

Christopher Null

Petite Powerhouse

Like its predecessors, the Mac Studio is a lunchbox-sized device that does not look at all like it should be the most powerful Mac ever made but rather like something that should be operating a really nice stereo system. But looks are of course deceiving, and inside the sealed box you’ll find plenty of oomph, designed with creators firmly in mind. I tested the entry-level M4 Max version, which includes a 14-core CPU, 32-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine, plus 36 GB of unified memory and a 512-GB SSD for $1,999. That lattermost spec feels a bit stingy in today’s clime, but it can be upgraded (only at purchase) on the M4 Max model all the way up to 8 TB of SSD storage.

For comparison, the $3,999 M3 Ultra version starts with a 28-core CPU, 60-core GPU, and 32-core Neural Engine, plus 96 GB of unified memory and a 1-TB SSD. Maxed out with an 80-core GPU, 512 GB of RAM, and a 16-TB SSD, your price tag will hit a cool $14,099. The most powerful Mac ever made may well equate to the most expensive Mac ever sold as well.

It perhaps goes without saying that the machine is meltingly fast, to the point where it’s hard to accurately convey its power in text. The M4 Pro-based Apple MacBook Pro I reviewed last fall probably provides the best comparison I can offer, considering it’s only one step down on the CPU ladder from the M4 Max.",0.9942,0.021,0.858,0.121
Apple,This Is the Year Apple and Samsung Will Compete for the Title of Thinnest Smartphone,The iPhone 17 Air is going to be thin. We already know the Galaxy S25 Edge is thin. What's the end game here?,https://gizmodo.com/this-is-the-year-apple-and-samsung-will-compete-for-the-title-of-thinnest-smartphone-2000574082,2025-03-10,"Another day, another iPhone leak, part of which we covered already last week. But this isn’t just about the iPhone 17 Air; eventually, I’ll bring up the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, too. Both devices have been trending in the gadget rumor space enough that multiple thinkpieces have sprouted about what this means for phone design.

This year, thin is in. I don’t like it. It’s not that I don’t like the idea of thinner, lighter smartphones—I enjoyed the lighter chassis on the Oppo Find N5 foldable—but with the uptick in the use of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss and the U.S. government moving to the right with each passing day, it feels a little too on the nose. Ultimately, these manufacturers want the marketing credit to say their devices are the thinnest. No one expected it to become the battle of svelte between the world’s two biggest phone manufacturers.

Varying reports allege the iPhone 17 Air will be the precursor to what Apple plans to do with its foldables. The idea is that whatever specifications the Air includes will lay the foundation for what’s essential inside an iPhone. The iPhone 16e already gave us a glimpse of what Apple thinks that is, but it’s in a different class than the iPhone 17 Air. The Air is supposed to exist between Apple’s essential iPhone and the everything-you-need iPhone Pro model, so it’ll probably be a little more beefy. Also, we’ve talked about how Apple’s iPhone 17 Air will supposedly look like Google’s Pixel devices from the backside. There are more renders making the rounds, including three-dimensional video. Ice Universe, a noted leaker in these parts, has already expressed excitement over it.

Samsung’s thin smartphone carries a different narrative, or at least it’s attempting to write its own. The Galaxy S25 Edge was a huge surprise when it was revealed after the Galaxy S25 Unpacked event. No one was expecting it, especially as we all had resigned ourselves to the idea that smartphone design had plateaued.

What’s wild is that even though I’ve seen it in person, we don’t have all the specifications for the Galaxy S25 Edge to know what Samsung considers “essential.” So far, we can infer that the processor and memory are the same as the rest of the Galaxy S25 family, and there’s a good chance Samsung will include the Galaxy S25 Ultra‘s 200-MP camera sensor right out of the gate. The rumors about the battery pack inside the Galaxy S25 Edge aren’t impressive, either. We’re talking about a 3,900 mAh battery, which is a little over 20 percent less than the size of what’s in the Galaxy S25 Ultra with the same camera sensor.

It’s curious to see Apple and Samsung compete for ultra-thinness because there are also many caveats involved with this form factor. (We knew it even back in the days of the Motorola Razr smartphone.) The battery usually takes a hit, as in the example of the Galaxy S25 Edge. There isn’t enough room for all the high-resolution camera equipment either. Ergonomics are also something to consider with this form factor, plus the practicality of carrying around such a thin device. And with all this focus on artificial intelligence, how will the smartphones perform to spec?

It’s unclear what the end goal is here besides bragging rights. The iPhone 17 Air doesn’t seem long for this world since analysts have said it is the precursor to the iPhone foldable. So when that arrives, what is the point of the iPhone 17 Air? Will it replace the iPhone Pro variant in some capacity? Or will ultra-thin be the new norm for smartphones going forward? Let’s see how it unfolds when Samsung launches the Galaxy S25 Edge soon.",0.9851,0.028,0.9,0.072
Apple,Six thoughts on Apple’s new M3 iPad Air,"This yearâs iPad Air was a surprise to me.

Apple launched the last Air less than a year ago, and that was a very good device that could already support Apple Intelligence — and most of Apple’s recent gadget upgrades have been about supporting Apple Intelligence. I figured Apple might launch a better Magic Keyboard for the Air (which it did), and that maybe we’d see some big new software ideas at WWDC this year. But a whole new model? Didn’t see that coming.

In fairness, there’s really only one new thing about the new model: it runs on an M3 chip instead of last year’s M2. So maybe instead of a whole new iPad Air, this is more like a mid-cycle refresh. Apple’s chip production changes, and so its devices change too. The new one, just like the old one, starts at $599 for the 11-inch model and $799 for the 13-inch screen. It comes in the same very pale colors. You get it.

I’ve had a 13-inch M2 Air for many months and an 11-inch M3 Air on my desk for the last several days. The story is the same as ever: it’s an excellent tablet, and I wish Apple would use iPadOS to make it a more versatile one. But we don’t need to litigate the reason for tablets to exist — you want to know if this is the tablet you should buy.

To that end, I have six thoughts that have come up in my testing that I think add up to something like an answer.

There’s no meaningful performance upgrade here. The M3 chip inside the new Air benchmarks at about 12–15 percent above the M2 in last year’s model. That’s actually a decent-sized bump, though it’s not the 2x jump Apple promises over the M1 from 2022. (I don’t have one of those handy, unfortunately, so I can’t test that number.) In practice, though, I don’t notice the difference. At all. Apps open at the same speed, games look and play the same, even apps like Procreate and Logic are equally responsive.

None of that is a problem with the M3, really, just a statement about how good the M2 already was. In general, I’d say the M3 seems closer to the M2 in performance than the M4 iPad Pro, which is still a half-beat faster on just about everything.

Graphics performance can be tricky to test on an iPad since there aren’t that many games designed to push the limits of the device. if I play Call of Duty: Mobile and crank everything to Max settings, I think I notice a slight difference in the details, particularly in shadows. But it’s subtle at best and possibly just a placebo.

But the keyboard is way better. Adding a row of function keys — for controlling volume and playback, opening the app switcher, and quickly locking the device — immediately makes the Air a more credible laptop replacement. (Until now, the Air’s was the only keyboard dock that didn’t have the function keys, which was just weird.) Apple says passthrough charging with the new Magic Keyboard charges the iPad as fast as plugging the tablet in directly, which makes it a really useful dock. It’s way too expensive an accessory, starting at $269, but it’s a very good one. The Pro keyboard is still the best one, though: it’s made of aluminum, has backlit keys and more feedback in the trackpad, and just feels nicer to tap on.

Another nice thing: the new keyboard is backwards compatible, so if you have an M2 Air it’ll work just fine with the new keyboard. In fact, if you can find one on sale, 2024 Air plus 2025 Magic Keyboard might be the Air combo I recommend most.

This thing really, really should support Face ID. Touch ID always made more sense to me on phones, which you typically hold the same way all the time, than on a tablet where notions of “bottom” and “top” are ever-changing. On the Face ID iPad Pro, you hardly ever need the power button; just tap the screen, and it wakes up and unlocks. On this Air, like other Touch ID iPads, it’s just annoying to sweep your thumb around the edges looking for the power button, where the sensor is.

In terms of day-to-day “design is how you use it” features, Face ID is the Pro upgrade I most want to see come to the Air.

Size matters. It might seem silly to say that a 13-inch iPad is very different from an 11-inch iPad, but those two inches of screen size really do change everything. When I use a 13-inch iPad, which is mostly what I’ve been testing recently, I hardly ever pick it up; it’s a desk-bound, keyboard-attached thing. An 11-inch model, on the other hand, is so much easier to hold in two hands (or even in one) that I find myself carrying it around a lot more.

If you want a larger model, I’d encourage you to consider the 13-inch Pro instead. If you’re thinking about the iPad as a productivity machine rather than a portable consumption tool, you’ll really benefit from the Pro’s better Magic Keyboard, its 120Hz screen, and its performance improvements. If you want something that is essentially your main computer, the iPad Pro is the way to go if you can afford it. But if the versatility of the small screen appeals to you, the 11-inch Air is a really nice option. You sacrifice some space, obviously, and the keyboard attachment is a bit more cramped, but I recommend the smaller models to people for the wieldability alone. I’m convinced that practically every iPad user is best-served by either the plain ol’ iPad or the 11-inch Air.

Apple Intelligence is the open question here. I haven’t been able to try the new base-model iPad yet, but I suspect that its story is fairly straightforward: the A16 Bionic chip is a nice upgrade, and it’ll be great for watching movies, browsing the web, and the other things everybody does on their iPad.

I can’t think of one reason Apple Intelligence would cause you to buy one device over another

But there are a couple of things the base model can’t do, like Stage Manager (not a problem) and the Pencil Pro (maybe a problem!). It’s also the only current iPad that doesn’t support Apple Intelligence. Right now, that does not matter one tiny bit. Seriously: I can’t think of one reason Apple Intelligence would cause you to buy one device over another in the near future. But if you’re bullish on the future of AI and you think Apple Intelligence is likely to be good before you’re looking to upgrade your iPad again, you might want the Air. I have no idea how to handicap the likelihood that AI gets good before your iPad dies — though it’s not a great sign that Apple just once again delayed the Siri improvements that might actually make Apple Intelligence compelling. Either way, that’s the biggest and most consequential difference between the devices right now.",0.9994,0.03,0.82,0.15

Last month, Apple released a new Invites app that allows iCloud+ subscribers to create invitations for any occasion, such as birthdays, dinner parties, graduations, baby showers, and more. The app is available on the App Store for the iPhone.



Anyone can RSVP to an invite from the Apple Invites app, even if they do not have an Apple Account or an Apple device, but creating an invitation requires an iCloud+ subscription. And since iCloud+ is included with all Apple One plans, including the Premier plan, this is a new perk to take advantage of at no additional cost.

The second new perk is Apple News+ Food.

The upcoming iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 updates add a new Food section to the Apple News app on the iPhone and iPad. This section will provide Apple News+ subscribers with tens of thousands of recipes and other food-related content from well-known food-related publishers, including Allrecipes, Bon Appétit, Food & Wine, Good Food, and Serious Eats.



Here is how Apple describes the new Food section:

With the new Food feature, users will be able to find stories curated by Apple News editors, as well as browse, search, and filter tens of thousands of recipes in the Recipe Catalog — with new recipes added every day. The beautifully designed recipe format makes it easy to review ingredients and directions, and a new cook mode takes step-by-step instructions to the full screen. Users can also save their favorite recipes for later and access them offline.

iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 are currently in beta. The updates will be released to the general public in April, according to Apple.

Apple News+ is available in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. It is included in the Apple One Premier plan only, so the new Food section will be another perk that comes exclusively with that tier.",0.989,0.018,0.876,0.106

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.

Apple plans to significantly redesign the look of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS later this year, Bloomberg reports.

The changes, which are set to arrive with iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16, will touch many parts of the operating systems, including “updating the style of icons, menus, apps, windows and system buttons,” Bloomberg says. The updates are also intended to simplify how people use Apple devices and make things more consistent across its software. The new design apparently takes some inspiration from the Vision Pro’s visionOS.

Bloomberg says the design updates will be the biggest for the Mac since macOS Big Sur and the biggest for iOS since iOS 7. However, Bloomberg notes that Apple isn’t going to merge its operating systems.

Apple is expected to announce the changes at its Worldwide Developers Conference, which typically happens in June. It hasn’t announced a date for this year’s show.

Apple,Patricia Arquette Breaks Down Severance‘s Latest Bombshell,The eighth episode of Severance season two is now streaming on Apple TV+.,https://gizmodo.com/patricia-arquette-severance-twist-apple-tv-plus-2000573250,2025-03-07,"If you’ve seen the latest episode of Severance, you know it ends with another huge revelation—one that we won’t spoil here at the top in case you haven’t seen it yet. But it involves Harmony Cobel, played by Patricia Arquette, who is front and center of the eighth episode called “Sweet Vitriol.” In a new interview, the True Romance star discussed not just what the bombshell reveal means for the future of the show, but how all the new information in the episode impacts her character.

The episode follows Cobel to her hometown of Salt’s Neck, which has been decimated by Lumon. There, in her childhood home, she finds an old notebook that proves she invented severance, not Jame Eagan. A secret she’s been hiding for years and has been told to repress. It means Cobel is much more invested in all of this than we even realized, and that the betrayal she feels from Lumon runs deeper too. Speaking to Collider, Arquette gave a bit more context and teased what it means for Cobel moving ahead.

“She was working on that with a bunch of people who were trying to work on that, because it had been one of Kier’s concepts, but they weren’t able to make that breakthrough, whereas she was able to come up with this,” Arquette said. “She also never got that kind of acknowledgment. Her mom wasn’t really around, her aunt wasn’t going to give it to her. Nobody’s really going to ever give her the approval that she’s been seeking her whole life, and she continues to seek. Nobody’s giving her the love that she longs for in some kind of way, the approval that she wishes she could have, but it’s really all she knows, this giant, broken, and complicated organization. But she is proud of herself inside, and I think she also does have a lot of what she considers righteous anger about what she is contributing and how that is just constantly being belittled and how she’s not being treated with any kind of respect.”

Because the audience first meets Cobel as a leader at Lumon, we see her as an authority figure. But here, Arquette flips that a bit and shows the character’s vulnerability—the way she’d been manipulated throughout her life and how she is now, finally, taking control.

Her life became much clearer over the course of the episode with the reveal of the Lumon ether factory, Cobel’s accomplishments as a child, and more. All of which, she revealed, she was aware of during season one. “Early on, I was given that I’d grown up in this town that was very impacted by Kier and Lumon, and that I’d gone to the school, and that my mother was an ether addict,” Arquette said. “Then, I started at school and there was this ether factory in town that kind of loomed large, and it environmentally destroyed this town. I’d already had all of that from the first season, but it was nice to be able to see the school, see the world, see the beginning.”

“Nice” for her, maybe, but terrifying and heartbreaking for us.

Hopefully we’ll see what Cobel does with the proof of link to severance, and how this past will impact the future, over the next two episodes as season two wraps up. You can stream Severance on Apple TV+ and read more from Arquette over at Collider.",-0.022,0.074,0.848,0.078
Apple,Samsung Android XR Headset Could Cost as Much as the Apple Vision Pro,"Rumors suggest Samsung’s ‘Project Moohan’ has even better displays than the Vision Pro, but that hints at a pricey VR headset.",https://gizmodo.com/samsung-android-xr-headset-could-cost-as-much-as-the-apple-vision-pro-2000573128,2025-03-07,"Samsung’s upcoming Android XR project is turning heads, not just because it has a variety of Vision Pro-like features, but because it may have even better displays than Apple’s $3,500 headset. That’s not necessarily a good thing. It would mean Samsung’s ‘Project Moohan’ could cost well over $1,000 just to stick a computer on your face. If Apple’s headset has taught us anything, it’s that few people want to spend anything more than $500 on a VR device.

As first spotted by 9to5Google, Korean tech news site The Elec reported based on anonymous industry sources that Samsung’s upcoming XR (extended reality) project has large and dense displays. As read with machine translation, The Elec claims the displays on its upcoming Android XR headset are 1.3-inch OLEDOS (OLED on Silicon) panels with a pixel density of 3,800 PPI, or pixels per inch. Compare that to the $500 Meta Quest 3’s displays at 1,200 PPI, and it’s already impressive. More importantly, it’s even more dense than the Apple Vision Pro’s similar micro-OLED panels, which cap out at 3,400 PPI.

The report notes that these panels are for the Project Moohan (Moohan means “infinity” in Korean) that’s still sitting behind closed doors at Samsung. As noted by The Elec, these types of displays are expensive. The panels for Samsung’s headset and the Vision Pro are produced by Sony. That company had shown off 1.3-inch, 4K OLED panels in 2023 costing more than $1,000. Even if Sony and Samsung mass manufacture these kinds of displays, Project Moohan would be shaping up to be a very expensive product.

Apple’s $3,500 “spatial computer” is one of the most capable headsets available with the best, prettiest OLED displays. Despite that, Apple has struggled to carve a niche for its ultra-expensive headset. Vision Pro sales in 2024 were down just a few months after launch. Late last year, The Information reported, based on anonymous sources, that Apple has quit production of the device, knowing it had enough components to meet demand.

Apple has been updating its headset over time, most recently bringing Apple Intelligence features to the visionOS 2. It technically offers some of the largest displays possible for streaming games or blowing your MacBook screen up to enormous, ultrawide proportions. The problem is the price and what you’re expected to do on Vision Pro. The lack of controllers essentially makes it useless for VR gaming. While Apple has brought more passive, short-form content to the platform, it’s not enough to entice more people to drop $3,500 on a new device.

Android XR is shaping up to be very, very similar to the Apple Vision Pro. YouTuber Marques Brownlee offered us our best look inside the Samsung headset. It has full-color passthrough with external cameras for augmented reality capabilities. This lets you manipulate your apps in 3D space. The big new feature is Google’s Gemini. The AI has access to Samsung’s external cameras, allowing users to ask it questions about the environment. For instance, Brownlee asked Gemini about a photo of the Wadi Rum desert in Jordan. The headset opened up Google Maps to show him the area through satellite imagery.

Is that the kind of feature that will have people lining up around the block to spend more than $2,000 on a headset? Probably not. The Vision Pro is capable, though it’s also bulky and uncomfortable after using it for too long. Samsung’s headset seems lighter than Apple’s, but that’s not the big reason consumers didn’t adopt the Vision Pro like Apple hoped they would. It’s a factor of price compared to its capabilities. The Vision Pro can act like a beautiful, massive TV, but only for one user at a time. You can get an excellent OLED TV for far less and enjoy it with your family.

The elephant in the room is Meta with its $500 Meta Quest 3 and $300 Meta Quest 3s. Any other competing headset, like the HTC Vive Focus Vision, can’t match its capabilities even at the $1,000 price point. Meta has had a head start ever since it bought Oculus back in 2014, and now it has a loss-leading position on the VR market. Still, even Meta does not seem immune to the idea of a more-expensive VR headset. Bloomberg recently reported that Meta is planning on a sequel to the more-expensive Meta Quest Pro. That headset sold so poorly the company dropped it from its lineup two years after launch.

Nobody is talking about the “metaverse” anymore, but companies like Google, Meta, and Apple all still think workers want to spend hours of their day trapped in a VR headset. VR or AR gaming is fun, but it’s not for anybody who gets motion sick or feels vertigo. Until these devices get as light and comfortable as a pair of glasses, XR won’t be the follow up to the smartphone as so many companies seem to think they are.",0.9969,0.045,0.835,0.12
Apple,"Apple AirTag 4-Pack Drops to Below $70 on Amazon, That’s Under $18 Each",Why buy one? Apple AirTag 4-Pack is a way better deal.,https://gizmodo.com/apple-airtag-4-pack-drops-to-below-70-on-amazon-thats-under-18-each-2000570061,2025-03-05,"Looking to stop losing your stuff? Apple’s AirTags have become the gold standard for keeping tabs on everything from keys to luggage, thanks to their seamless integration with the massive Find My network. These tiny trackers pack impressive tech into a coin-sized package, making them practically invisible while keeping your valuables just a tap away on your iPhone.

Amazon’s serving up a killer deal on the AirTag 4-pack right now – just $70, down from the usual $99. That’s a hefty $29 discount (29% off), bringing the per-tracker cost down to about $18 each. For Apple gear, this kind of discount doesn’t come around often.

See AirTag (4-Pack) at Amazon

Affordable item tracking powered by Apple

Setup couldn’t be simpler – just hold an AirTag near your iPhone and it’s ready to go. The Find My app instantly shows you where your tagged items are, whether they’re in the next room or across the country. Lost your keys behind the couch? The Precision Finding feature (on newer iPhones) will literally point you to them, using ultra-wideband technology to guide you with arrow-precise directions.

What makes AirTags special is their access to Apple’s Find My network. Hundreds of millions of Apple devices act like a search party for your lost items, all working anonymously and securely in the background. If you leave something behind, you’ll know exactly where to find it. Lost Mode even sends you automatic notifications when your item is detected.

Privacy is baked in from the start. All tracking data is encrypted, and Apple’s built-in safeguards help prevent unwanted tracking. The system will even alert you if an unknown AirTag is traveling with you – a feature that’s set the standard for tracker safety. Your location data and history are never stored on the AirTag itself.

These things are built to last, too. The replaceable battery keeps going for over a year, and the IP67 rating means rain and dust won’t stop them from working. When the battery finally dies, just pop in a new one and you’re good to go. Plus, you can always ask Siri to help find your stuff – just ask and your AirTag will play a sound to help you locate it.

At $70 for four AirTags, this is basically impulse-buy territory for anyone deep in the Apple ecosystem. Whether you’re tired of hunting for your keys every morning or want peace of mind when traveling with checked bags, this deal makes it easy to tag everything important in your life. Just remember to grab some holders or key rings – they’re sold separately, but worth it for keeping your AirTags securely attached to your belongings.

You can also buy the new Mac Studio with an M4 Max chip starting at $1,999 or an M3 Ultra-powered model starting at $3,999.

The new 13- and 15-inch MacBook Airs run on Apple’s M4 chip, which Apple claims is twice as fast as the M1 chip found in the 2020 model. Both laptops also now support up to two external displays, even with the lid still open, and boast the same 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam found in the latest MacBook Pros. Design-wise, they’re identical to their M3-powered predecessor, but Apple’s now added a sky blue color option.

Previously a contributor to Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, and US News.

Apple is bringing AI-generated review summaries to the app store with iOS 18.4. As spotted by Macworld, the latest developer beta for iOS and iPadOS adds brief summaries of user reviews to some App Store listings.

The summaries are generated by large language models to “compile highlights and key information from users’ reviews into short paragraphs,” according to details on Apple’s developer site.

Based on Apple’s example, the summaries use natural language to highlight what users say about the app, starting with positive feedback and finishing with negative feedback. Apple says the summaries will be refreshed at least once a week as new reviews are added, and users will be able to tap and hold on a review to report any problems with the feature.

The summaries will initially be available in the US App Store for apps and games published in English, and only to those with enough reviews to generate a summary. They will be available in other countries and languages later this year.

Apple’s move follows Amazon’s addition of AI-generated review highlights to its e-commerce site in 2023. These short paragraphs “highlight the product features and customer sentiment frequently mentioned across written reviews” and appear above the full reviews.

In theory, review summaries should be helpful, saving you from reading through a bunch of reviews to get the “highlights.” But they also feel potentially ripe for gaming and will likely only encourage unscrupulous companies to flood review sections.

From my experience with Amazon’s summaries, I find that its focus on the positive aspects first can feel disingenuous. I review products for a living, and if something is bad, that will absolutely be the first thing I say.",0.8462,0.028,0.909,0.063

Apple took the sheet off its new M4 MacBook Air models Wednesday. Though the big news is that MacBook Air now supports the full M4 chip with its 10-core GPU, we’re more excited about the $1,000 starting price and the lovely “sky blue” color that’s not just another gray MacBook.

The MacBook Air bears a striking semblance to last year’s M3 model, even with the new colorway. However, there are a few extra benefits to the new chip. The main new feature is the ability to use the MacBook Air with two external displays and keep using the MacBook’s own screen. It supports two displays up to 6K resolution and 60 Hz refresh rates over USB-C. The M3 MacBook Airs supported two external displays, though you were forced to keep the lid closed.

As for screen and ports, its what you’ve come to expect from a MacBook Air. It includes the usual MagSafe 3 charging port and two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports. While the MacBook Pro upgraded to Thunderbolt 5, you won’t be getting the same throughput on Apple’s thinner design. It features the same Liquid Retina IPS LCD panel with a claimed 500 nits of peak brightness.

The M4 MacBook Air starts with 16 GB of RAM (which has become standard since Apple started promoting its Apple Intelligence updates) and you can opt for a version with either an 8- or 10-core GPU. The 13-inch versions with the better GPU start at $1,200, but a base model with the less-capable M4 goes for $1,000, which was last year’s price for the M2 MacBook Air. The 15-inch MacBook Air M4 starts at $1,200.

Preorders are available starting Wednesday, and the laptop is expected to ship March 12.

It’s been more than 10 months since Apple debuted the M4 chip with the iPad Pro from 2024. Then, in November, the tech giant brought us the MacBook Pro with M4 along with the new M4 Pro and M4 Max chips. These have become my go-to Macs, even though the M4 Pro Mac mini remains an enticing proposition. Now, the MacBook Air completes the trifecta of user-end Mac products. There’s also an ultra-expensive Mac Studio, and the big news there is it comes with a M3 Ultra chip.

If the MacBook Air M4 is anything like the M3 MacBook Air, it will see MacBook Pro levels of performance in most benchmarks, though perhaps with worse graphical performance if it lacks a few GPU cores, as we saw with M3. Still, the thinnest MacBook models have proved to be solid workhorse machines, despite them having the same look and displays for more than two years.

While the other Apple news for Wednesday was a new Mac Studio, it’s been an Air-filled week for Apple. The tech giant announced new iPad Air models with the M3 chip on Tuesday. Those devices are similarly sized to last year’s M2 models, though Apple promises they should be better at graphics processing tasks. There’s also a new version of the basic iPad with an A16 chip. Despite Apple’s talk about giving everything access to Apple Intelligence, that’s one of the few new devices in its current lineup that won’t support any of Apple’s AI.",0.9824,0.011,0.915,0.074

Apple is pushing back against the UK’s secret order to give the government access to encrypted iCloud files. The company has filed an appeal with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which deals with complaints about the “unlawful intrusion” of UK intelligence services and authorities, according to a report from the Financial Times.

As noted by FT, the tribunal will “consider whether the UK’s notice to Apple was lawful and, if not, could order it to be quashed.” The tribunal could reportedly hear the case as soon as this month. Apple stopped offering Advanced Data Protection in the UK in response to the secret order, and now it looks like the company is attempting to put a stop to it altogether. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

In January, the UK government issued the order under the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, according to a report from The Washington Post. It specifically targets iCloud’s Advanced Data Protection option that uses end-to-end encryption to secure backups, preventing third parties – including Apple itself – from accessing them.

Xiaomi’s new 15 Ultra is dominated by an enormous ring of cameras on the back, Nothing has rethought its camera layout from scratch to fit a periscope into the Phone 3A Pro, and consistent rumors suggest that even Apple is going to strap a big ol’ camera bar onto the back of its iPhone 17 Pro models later this year. But why stop there? What if you could get all of the heft and weight of a real camera and burden your phone with it? What if we could make your phone camera much, much bigger?

That’s what both Xiaomi and Realme have attempted to do at this year’s Mobile World Congress, with two very different concept phones that each attempt to bridge the gap between a smartphone and a DSLR.

Realme’s concept has a bare sensor where a lens would normally be. This bulky mount is what lets you attach a regular lens. This lens alone weighs several times more than the phone itself.

Realme’s attempt is the most familiar. In fact, its “interchangeable lens concept,” which mounts a full DSLR lens onto the existing camera island of its concept phone, is remarkably similar to a concept that Xiaomi already showed off in 2022. The phone here is itself custom, not based on any of Realme’s existing smartphones, and includes two typical cameras on the rear, plus a third, customized one-inch-type sensor from Sony with no lens on top — at least not until you add your own via a proprietary lens mount. At its core, this is similar to the approach we’ve seen for years from companies like Moment, which sells small custom lenses that attach to your phone’s camera. But bigger means better, right?

Realme has designed its concept to work with two lenses: a 73mm portrait and a 234mm telephoto, and I got to try the latter. You won’t be surprised to hear that strapping an enormous telephoto lens to one end of a phone does throw off the balance somewhat, and I wouldn’t exactly call this practical. The ergonomics are challenging: because a phone is so much thinner and lighter than a camera body, I had no choice but to grab the lens fully by the barrel. All the weight rests there, leaving my left hand trying to simultaneously grip the lens tight enough to hold the whole thing up but loose enough to still rotate the zoom and focus, with my right hand essentially unable to help. It’s awkward.

The lens mount alone is a fairly substantial bit of kit, protruding an inch or so from the phone’s back, meaning there’s no way at all to make this experience a compact one — even a pancake lens is going to feel enormous here. Realme has used a standard M mount, so in theory you can attach any compatible lens, which would really be the appeal if this ever became a product. In practice it might not be so simple, as Realme has made some tweaks to its camera app to accommodate these two specific lenses. The mounting connection is a purely physical one as well, so for now there’s no way for this to handle autofocus lenses or anything else beyond the manual.

Xiaomi’s lens sits on the phone’s body, not its camera module. The lens attaches with a magnetic ring and two small connectors. Xiaomi only showed off this single lens of its own design.

Xiaomi’s approach solves a lot of those problems, while introducing its own. Its Modular Optical System is built around a custom version of the Xiaomi 15 with a ring of MagSafe-esque magnets on the back. A separate lens attaches to that magnetic contact point in the center of the phone, but crucially it includes its own sensor, so you’re not limited by the hardware inside the phone. It’s a modern, magnetic version of Sony’s short-lived line of QX cameras that could clamp onto the back of any phone.

The one lens Xiaomi is showing off right now is a 35mm with an aperture of f/1.4, using a 100-megapixel 4/3-type sensor — bigger than you’ll find in any smartphone, including Realme’s concept. That means more light capture, and in theory better photos. Daniel Desjarlais, Xiaomi’s director of international communications, told me that the chance to include a bigger sensor is the main reason the company is exploring this form factor.

There are two contacts within the magnetic ring, which help with alignment but also handle both power and wireless data transfer over a 10Gbps optical transmission system that Xiaomi is calling LaserLink. Unlike Realme’s physical connection, that means this lens supports autofocus, though Xiaomi still included a manual focus ring for fine-tuning. Images go through the phone’s own image processing software, so you’ll get a style that’s similar to the phone’s other photos.

Alongside enabling a bigger sensor, the other benefit of building everything into the modular lens is that it can attach to the middle of the phone, rather than having to be built on top of the pre-existing camera module. That means this feels much better balanced, and more comfortable to hold and use. Attaching and detaching the lens is a single quick action, and with no intermediary mount this is more compact than Realme’s design could ever be. I can actually imagine shooting with this day-to-day, especially if there was also the option to attach something like the grip from Xiaomi’s 15 Ultra Photography Kit.

There are downsides, of course. The magnetic attachment feels strong — Xiaomi encouraged me to hold the phone upside down by the lens and shake, and it survived the experience — but a proper camera mount will always be stronger. Desjarlais admitted to me that the magnetic connection probably rules out a full-size telephoto lens simply by virtue of the weight, though perhaps that’s for the best.

Lens options are the other downside. There’s an awful lot of proprietary tech in here, and no-one else is building modular magnetic lenses with sensors built-in. That means any version of this that ever came to market wouldn’t be interoperable with any existing lenses, which might kill half the appeal for the photographer audience it would hope to reach.

I haven’t spoken about image quality from either of these concepts yet. I wasn’t able to get my own sample photos from either device, and a few minutes at a trade show don’t give much scope for thorough testing. I absolutely believe that both will deliver better photos than a regular smartphone can, but that’s just a matter of physics — better lenses and bigger sensors result in nicer photos. The real question is whether they’d be improved enough to justify the hassle and cost a setup like this would always involve, especially as phones like the Xiaomi 15 Ultra have gotten closer and closer to DSLR quality. The reason I use my phone more than any other camera is because it fits in my pocket and it’s always there. The best lens for it will always be one that fits in my pocket too.",0.998,0.038,0.86,0.102
Apple,"Apple 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Air : Price, Specs, Availability",The 11-inch and 13-inch tablets have the same look as before but with a minor boost in performance. The new iPads ship on March 12.,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-new-ipad-air-m3-chip/,2025-03-04,"Less than a year after upgrading its iPad Air with the M2 chip, Apple is already back with an enhanced version. Today, the company announced an all-new iPad Air, complete with the M3 chipset. But the updates don't stop there—the company also unveiled a long overdue refresh of its base iPad model, adding an A16 chipset and double the storage. All tablets are available for preorder today and will ship on March 12.

The seventh-generation iPad Air doesn't have any noteworthy hardware upgrades. As with its predecessor, you'll have the choice between an 11-inch and 13-inch display sizes—both of which have slim bezels, Touch ID integrated into the top button, a 12-megapixel landscape selfie camera, and a 12-megapixel rear camera.

The new iPad Air comes with the M3 chipset. Apple

You'll find the significant changes under the hood. Apple updated the tablet with an M3 chip, which the company first debuted back in 2023, alongside the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro and 24-inch iMac. It's since made its way to last year's MacBook Air (13-inch and 15-inch). It's not the latest chip (Apple launched the M4 back in May), but it's still considered powerful and fairly new.

Equipped with an 8-core CPU and 9-core GPU, Apple claims CPU performance is up to 35 percent faster than the iPad Air with M1, while graphics are up to 40 percent faster. The M3 also supports features like mesh shading, ray tracing, and dynamic caching for graphics-intensive tasks.

The company says the Neural Engine is also up to 60 percent faster compared to the M1 for “AI-based workloads.” This will help to power Apple Intelligence—the company's suite of AI features like Mail Summaries, Smart Replies in Messages, Writing Tools Cleanup in Apple Photos, Genmoji, and more. You can read all about these features and more in our roundup of macOS Sequoia features.

Apple also released a new version of its Magic Keyboard case for the iPad Air. It comes with the same upgrades you'll find on the latest version for the iPad Pro, including a larger built-in trackpad along with a row of keys for functions like screen brightness and volume control. It's a bit more affordable this time around too, starting at $269 for the 11-inch tablet and $319 for the 13-inch version. As with the M2 iPad Air, it's compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Pencil (USB-C) as well.",0.9904,0.0,0.902,0.098

Apple’s latest iOS 18.4 developer beta adds the Visual Intelligence feature, the company’s Google Lens-like tool, to the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, as reported by 9to5Mac.

Apple had told Daring Fireball that the feature would be coming to those iPhones in a future software update but didn’t say which. Barring any last-minute changes, it now seems like it will be available widely with the official rollout of iOS 18.4, which is expected in April.

Visual Intelligence launched as a feature accessible from the Camera Control button for the iPhone 16 lineup that debuted in September. Because the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max don’t have the Camera Control button, you’ll instead be able to use Visual Intelligence through the Action Button or via Control Center, similar to the newly launched iPhone 16E.

According to 9to5Mac, today’s iOS 18.4 developer beta 2 update also brings the Action Button and Control Center options for Visual Intelligence to the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup.",0.9682,0.0,0.886,0.114

Google’s Gemini app for iOS and iPadOS now includes a handful of lockscreen widgets that make it easier (and faster) to access the AI assistant’s various features. As noted by 9to5Google, the app’s latest update adds six widgets in total, with each of them letting you hop right into a particular Gemini function.

The company seems to be making a very intentional effort to lure iPhone and iPad users away from Siri — or at least get people using Gemini instead of OpenAI’s ChatGPT whenever they want to interact with a large language model. Google has also recently been advertising Gemini on Apple-centric tech podcasts.

This all comes as Apple reportedly finds itself making slow progress at developing a smarter, more capable Siri that can compete with today’s leading AI platforms. Over the weekend, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that a truly overhauled Siri is likely still several years away. So if you’re Google, this full-court press to establish familiarity with Gemini in the meantime makes a lot of sense. Apple itself may offer Gemini as yet another resource for Apple Intelligence in the coming months.

As for the widgets, here’s what Google says each one does:

Type prompt : Stuck on a question? Type anything right away.

Talk Live : Talk things through, or brainstorm aloud with Gemini.

Open mic : Quickly open your mic to set reminders, create calendar events, and more.

Use camera : Take a photo of what’s in front of you, and ask Gemini questions all about it.

Share image : Choose an image to get more info, create new art, or start a chat.

Share file: Use a file to share the information or inspiration behind your question.

Apple,Tim Cook Teases New Apple ‘Air’ Products Coming Very Soon,Apple is likely to release a MacBook Air or even a new iPad Air this week.,https://gizmodo.com/tim-cook-teases-new-air-products-coming-very-soon-2000570839,2025-03-03,"The air floating up from Apple’s spaceship headquarters is starting to smell like fan-less laptop exhaust. In a post to X, Apple CEO Tim Cook tells fans there is “something in the air”—and it’s probably the next MacBook Air.

Sure, Cook doesn’t give anything anyway, but unless something truly surprising happens we expect the MacBook Air M4 is on the horizon. The timing is right, considering Apple launched the M3 MacBook Air 13 and 15 last March. Recent reports from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman hinted that we’d see a MacBook Air reveal soon. In his latest newsletter, Gurman remarked Apple could launch the MacBook Air as early as this week.

Apple may have more Airs in store. Gurman was first to note that Apple is winding down on iPad Air inventory, meaning we could have new iPad Airs with updated chips compared to last year’s 11- and 13-inch renditions with M2 silicon. Just don’t assume we’ll get the rumored iPhone 17 Air. Knowing Apple’s release schedule, that thin mobile device won’t be around until later this year.

We don’t expect many major design changes for Apple’s next lightweight MacBook. Apple has kept the flat, squared MacBook aesthetic the same since the M2 MacBook Air. We have our money on Apple launching a 15- and 13-inch variant, just like last year. Recent benchmark leaks suggest Apple will keep the M4 chip the same across both MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, though likely with less graphical prowess on the shorter machine, like it was on the M3.

Rumors also suggest we may see the MacBook Air support two displays as well as the display on the MacBook, if Apple upgrades ports to Thunderbolt 5 from Thunderbolt 4 on the M3 MacBook Air.

Apple’s last big hardware drop, the iPhone 16e, came in the middle of the week with a similar teaser from Cook on DOGE captain Elon Musk’s favorite platform. Apple then announced its new, $600 iPhone six days later. The MacBook Air could get its reveal later this week, though we don’t know if it will be as light and airy a launch as was Apple’s latest “budget” smartphone.",0.9666,0.018,0.907,0.075

The NHL Watch Comms app allows referees to receive in-game updates by syncing with the NHL's Oasis system. Officials can track the game clock and receive alerts for key game events without diverting their focus. This allows referees to avoid locating video boards while officiating.

The app includes haptic feedback to indicate key moments, such as when a player leaves the penalty box or when the period is about to end. Distinct haptic patterns allow referees to differentiate between different notifications without needing to check the screen. The Apple Watches used in NHL games will be league-issued, providing the option of either the Apple Watch Ultra or the Series 10.

Since 2017, the NHL has integrated iPads and Macs into coaching and player workflows, providing teams with real-time access to game footage and analytics. Apple has also worked with other professional sports leagues to bring its wearable technology into competition settings. In 2023, the World Surf League adopted the Apple Watch as its official wearable, using it to deliver real-time scoring, wave priority, and heat times to competitors in the water.",-0.1531,0.024,0.954,0.021

Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.

The Apple Watch is now the smartwatch of choice for National Hockey League officials. Apple and the NHL just announced a collaboration where on-ice officials will wear Apple Watches that are running special software to receive important in-game information.

Using the custom-built NHL Watch Comms app, on-ice referees can view the game clock directly from their wrist. They’ll also be able to receive haptic alerts for when NHL players leave the penalty box or when time is running out in the period. The haptic patterns for each timer are different, so as not to confuse the officials. The Apple Watches will also be synced to the NHL’s Oasis feed, a cloud system that enables player tracking, game telemetry, and other data, which will ensure that all officials receive the same information.

“We wanted to make sure that the officials had really good awareness and were able to keep their eyes on play,” says Andres de Corral, vice president of digital services at Presidio, a tech firm that helped develop the app. “So by enabling haptic responses, we were able to provide non-visual cues to the officials.”

Situational awareness is a major challenge for officials on the ice. On top of making calls, they also have to keep track of the puck, get out of the players’ way, and keep track of zones on the ice and players leaving and entering the penalty box.

“As they’re doing all those things, it sounds crazy to say, but they’re also trying to find the game clock on the video board,” explains Dave Lehanski, the NHL’s executive vice president of business development and innovation. Given how fast hockey games move, Lehanski notes it’s less than ideal for officials to constantly crane their necks up to view the game clock.

Officials can choose between the rugged Ultra or the slimmer Series models. Some officials, for example, have to wear thicker wrist guards so the thinner profile on Series makes more sense. Regardless, these Apple Watches won’t be personal watches. Corral says they will be specific to in-game use so that all officials have a uniform experience.

This is not the first time Apple and the NHL have collaborated on in-game tech. Since 2017, the league has used iPads and Macs to deliver game video to coaches and players on the bench so they can make in-game adjustments. It’s also not Apple’s first time working with a sports league in this capacity. In 2023, the World Surf League adopted the Apple Watch as its “official wearable” to deliver real-time information to surfers during competitions.

Apple,Severance‘s Shifting Perspectives Make Its Fractured Reality Even More Fascinating,This week's episode of the Apple TV+ series brought fresh nuance to its core storyline.,https://gizmodo.com/severances-shifting-perspectives-make-its-fractured-reality-even-more-fascinating-2000569620,2025-02-28,"From the start, Severance has offered a captivating take on how perspectives can change within a single story, and even within the minds of individual characters. As season two began, the show gave us back-to-back episodes that showed the immediate fallout of the season one finale—in which the “innies” briefly awakened and experienced life as their “outies”—from different points of view, with the non-severed characters also getting space to share their reactions.

As season two has progressed, Severance has continued to explore this aspect of its storytelling, giving us more time with the outies to balance out season one’s innie focus, and presenting constant surprises to the audience as a result. Certain things that we believed to be true are in fact completely false, shaped by Lumon Industries’ unique ability to massage reality for its employees who aren’t able to access their full consciousness. And while the innies’ world is almost entirely fabricated, some of that massaging has happened in the outie world, too.

This week’s episode, “Chikai Bardo” was perhaps Severance’s most poignant and wrenching to date. And a lot of that has to do with which character got to be its protagonist.

Gemma (Dichen Lachman) was a peripheral character for most of season one. We first meet her as Ms. Casey, the counselor in Lumon’s Wellness Center. She has a stilted, almost robotic presence—and she’s aware of it; “I know I’m strange,” she says at one point. Midway through season one, of course, we discover that Ms. Casey is actually Gemma, the wife of main character Mark (Adam Scott).

Gemma’s “death” in a car accident two years prior is why Mark decided to get the severance procedure and take a job at Lumon. She’s alive, sure, but she’s not living much of a life; she’s somehow been absorbed into Lumon and isn’t allowed to leave. How and especially why this occurred, and what it has to do with Mark’s yet-to-be-revealed true purpose at Lumon, have become the biggest mysteries looming over Severance season two.

Mark’s innie knows Ms. Casey is his outie’s wife. And Mark’s outie has accepted the wonderful/horrible truth that Gemma is still alive, to the point that he’s allowing his own brain to be mangled in an attempt to re-integrate its divided sides. But it’s all been about his pain until this point. In episode seven, we finally got Gemma’s perspective on her (very grim) current state of existence, as well as her own memories of her relationship with Mark.

Her different innie personas are awakened for the “testing” she’s put through in Lumon’s sub-basement severed rooms; some of those we get to see, others we don’t. But it’s Gemma herself that’s the most intriguing. Before “Chikhai Bardo,” Gemma was a smiling woman in a wedding photograph. She was a woman her husband wistfully remembered as “extraordinary,” someone who made him a better person. So it’s startling that the first time we really meet her is as a Lumon lab rat. The precise levers that were pulled to get her there are still a mystery, but thanks to “Chikhai Bardo” we have an illuminating picture of her life before.

Severance takes full advantage of this departure from its usual setting and style, transporting us through Gemma’s memories using unfamiliar lighting (sunshine!), flowing camera movements, and even production design touches that prove “stark winter” isn’t the only season in its world. We even hear birds chirping at one point.

But that happy, gauzy montage soon spirals into something much darker and sadder: tension in the marriage that crops up as they navigate fertility struggles. This was never mentioned in season one—in which Mark’s sister Devon gave birth to a daughter—but it was clearly and understandably a devastating issue for Mark and Gemma. The way “Chikhai Bardo” cuts from Gemma and Mark grieving their loss into a scene fans will instantly remember from season one—Ms. Casey telling Mark’s innie that she’s been detailed to his department to watch over the potentially suicidal Helly R.—brings an entirely new meaning to their interaction. They don’t recognize each other, but Ms. Casey’s explanation that “I am to watch her for signs of sadness” is suddenly a thousand times more searing.

As “Chikhai Bardo” puzzle-pieces other aspects of Gemma and Ms. Casey’s lives together (and stirs up fodder for dozens more Severance fan theories), it ends by shifting from Gemma’s point of view back to Mark’s. He’s essentially been in a coma for the entire episode, and when he wakes up, a concerned Devon asks him where he “went.” He doesn’t answer, and it’s actually unclear at first which version of Mark this is. But the camera shows us what’s dancing through his mind, and there’s no doubt: he was thinking only of Gemma, and we realize we’ve really been seeing both of their memories meshed together throughout the episode.

As Severance season two heads into its final episodes, it will surely leave some dangling threads, if not a massive cliffhanger. So far “Chikhai Bardo” is the closest we’ve gotten to a flashback episode, and it feels possible that we might get more in that vein: a deep dive into Harmony Cobel’s psyche, or a look at Burt’s early days at Lumon, or the origins of Kier Eagan’s cult-leader aspirations. But even beyond that, this week was a vivid illustration of one big reason why Severance has hooked so many fans: its mysteries contain multitudes, with ever-changing context that somehow constantly stuffs even more layers of meaning into what’s already a compelling story.",0.9091,0.055,0.871,0.074

He’s been a tech journalist for almost 20 years.

Tri-folds are having a moment. There’s that impressive Huawei device, my favorite 3-in-1 Apple charger, and now this: the Zip tri-fold projector from a company called Aurzen. It’s the most gadgety gadget I’ve tested in a long time.

The Zip’s heft, texture, and hinge stiffness evokes quality at first touch and it’s impressively bright for a compact battery-powered projector that costs $299.

Using it is also a joy. It connects quickly to iPhones over AirPlay and to Android devices over Miracast, Smart View, or similar using Wi-Fi Direct — no hotspot required. It then automatically focuses and aligns the image on any available flat surface including walls, t-shirts, and pillows. It works in both landscape and portrait modes and pairs with Bluetooth headsets for private audio or Bluetooth speakers for a shared experience. The built-in rechargeable battery lasts about 80 minutes in my real-world testing, but you can always plug it into a powerbank or wall jack to extend that.

Using it sucks, however, if you’re trying to stream from services like Netflix and Disney Plus or trying to watch Spotify music videos. That’s because all those companies protect their content with DRM, and Zip’s mirroring feature “doesn’t meet HDCP content protection standards,” according to a popup message I received when trying to stream video from Amazon Prime.

Otherwise, it mirrored everything I could see on my iPhone, Mac, and Android phone, including Plex videos, games, locally stored media, PDFs, PowerPoints, and every app that I opened.

The Zip is so easy to carry and set up that I’ve been using it almost daily over the last few weeks.

I used it on a 10-hour train ride to watch downloaded movies with Bluetooth headphones. I’ve used it in the bedroom paired to a Bluetooth speaker to watch a film streamed over Plex with my wife after the kids took over the television. But mostly I’ve been using it on any suitably flat surface to aimlessly flip through my social media feeds or play some casual games on a screen that’s much larger than my iPhone. A friend said he’d love to borrow the Zip projector for PowerPoint presentations at client sites, and I can see it playing a recurring role in my vanlife adventures to come.



The Zip’s Z-shape works either upright for films and YouTube, or on its side for full-screen portrait video favored by TikTok and Instagram Reels. When upright, you can easily adjust the hinges to get just the right angle and image size. When sideways you have to get more creative to avoid obstacles.

You can place it anywhere. Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge It really is tiny.

The autofocus works well, but the auto-keystone correction has a very limited range and works best when the Zip is placed directly in front of the projection surface. If you don’t like the results you can give the projector a little shake to try again — just don’t expect miracles. The Zip’s base is metal so it can be affixed to magnetic mounts, including Aurzen’s own $25 suction-mount.



If streaming services are critical to your usage, then Aurzen offers a bulky $65 CastPlay HDMI dongle as a work around. Modern phones with USB-C ports that support video output can then stream DRM-protected content directly to the Zip using a USB-C to HDMI adapter. It works on my iPhone 15 Pro and Oppo Find X3 Pro with a random adapter I purchased on Amazon for $7, but adds too much cost and complexity to a device that thrives on its simplicity.

Aurzen tells me that the Zip — currently available for $249 early bird pricing on Kickstarter — will cost $299 starting March 1st. Both prices seem reasonable for the experience provided. The average price will eventually rise to about $349 once it moves to Amazon which is a bit steep for a portable projector that can’t easily stream your favorite shows.

The iPhone 16E is everything I love and hate about iOS. FaceTime at your fingertips. A reliable camera. Simplicity. Familiarity. They’re the pillars of the iPhone experience, and Apple’s newest phone has ‘em.

My husband picked up the 16E, concerned that he would have to “learn something new” to use it. He swiped around for a second and said, “Oh. It’s just like my phone.” It is just like his phone — a six-year-old iPhone XR — only updated with a few essential improvements (a faster processor, nicer screen, and a modern camera, that kind of thing) and little else.

That’s the other pillar of the iPhone experience: You get exactly what Apple gives you and nothing more. On Android, you can buy a $500 phone with a fast refresh-rate screen, two rear cameras, seven years of software support, and wireless charging. On iOS, you can buy this $599 phone with one rear camera, a standard 60Hz screen, wireless charging (but no MagSafe), and an ample but unstated amount of software support. Apple has no competition when it comes to phones running iOS. The company can gatekeep these conveniences behind a higher price tag, and that’s simply the way things will be. I’m looking at you, ProMotion.

This is the world the iPhone 16E enters. It’s Apple’s cheapest phone, but it’s not cheap — probably for the aforementioned “lack of competition” reasons. It’s an iPhone that does iPhone things, but it’s probably missing at least one major feature for any given buyer, whether that’s an extra camera or the convenience of a MagSafe ring. If you’re clinging desperately to an older model and want a new iPhone for the least possible money, the 16E is the one to get.

That’s the job of the 16E: be the path of least resistance to blue bubbles. But for a more discerning customer the answer’s not as clear-cut.

The iPhone 16E is the spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, though Apple would rather you not think of it that way. The SE was the company’s budget-friendly line, a kind of close-out bargain bin offer on last generation’s chassis with upgraded internals. The design was wildly outdated by the end, but, hey, it only cost $429. That line appears to have ended with the 16E, which is fully a member of the iPhone 16 series.

Instead of an older design that’s a really good deal, we have a modern design that’s only kind of a deal

But instead of an older design that’s a really good deal, we have a modern design that’s only kind of a deal. It’s $200 cheaper than the $799 iPhone 16 and has a similar 6.1-inch OLED screen. There’s no Dynamic Island — just a notch. And instead of two rear lenses, you get just one: a 48-megapixel main camera and no ultrawide to go with it. You get wired charging, but no MagSafe. The Action Button, but no Camera Control. This, not that. And so on.

There’s a kind of equation that can help determine how much you should care about this list of missing features. How old is your current phone? Do other people in your household use MagSafe accessories that you want to share? Do you even know what MagSafe is? Would you like to follow sports scores at the top of your screen while you do other things on your phone, or are you a Seattle Mariners fan? (Love hurts, guys.) I don’t know what that exact formula is because I barely scraped by in calculus, but just bear it in mind as you read the rest of this review.

The notch lives.

The 16E’s screen is very likely a version of the iPhone 14’s screen, complete with a notch housing the Face ID and front-facing camera array. The regular 16’s screen gets just a little brighter in theory, but in practice they look about the same to me, brightness-wise. The 16E’s screen doesn’t go down to one nit like the 16’s can, which is too bad because it’s honestly cool as hell and handy when you’re trying not to wake up your spouse with a bright phone screen. The notch’s existence also means no Dynamic Island — that’s the pill-shaped cutout Apple introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro, which houses tiny bits of timely info you might want to see at a glance.

All that time-sensitive information, like live sports scores and the proximity of your incoming Uber, is still presented on the 16E’s lock screen. But the Dynamic Island keeps it at the top of your screen while you do other things on your phone. It’s handy, and having gotten used to it, I missed it on the 16E. The extra visual confirmation is nice when you have a timer or screen recording in progress. The Dynamic Island probably won’t be a great loss if you’re used to a phone without it, though.

MagSafe might be another case of “if you’ve never had it then you won’t miss it,” but I’m a little less inclined to shrug off its absence on the 16E. Sure, there’s still Qi wireless charging. And you can always use a case with magnets as a workaround if you want to use MagSafe accessories, even if it’s not an elegant solution. But the beauty of MagSafe is the simplicity, and if you’re a case-hater like me then it’s a handy way to add a Pop Socket or a low-profile wallet to your phone without committing to a case. Aside from the SE, every iPhone from the 12-series onward has MagSafe. It feels like a standard feature now, and it’s hard to understand why Apple left it out.

Spend more money, get more cameras.

The iPhone 16E’s rear camera uses a 48-megapixel sensor that combines pixels to help it better gather light, and it delivers nice images in most situations. There’s no ultrawide camera and therefore no macro photography either. I missed the ultrawide more than once when stepping backward to frame a wide shot wasn’t possible. There’s a decent portrait mode, though it’s the older version where you can’t change the focus point after the fact. Photographic Styles are available to help dial in color reproduction, though they’re also the previous-gen version and you can’t tweak undertones.

This is a camera system most people will be perfectly happy with. If you’re the least bit inclined photographically and want more flexibility — both in focal range and processing options — then consider an iPhone 16 or 16 Pro. But it’s a good camera for a general audience. There’s excellent 4K video recording, optical image stabilization, and reliable color reproduction. A more advanced phone camera would offer better chances of capturing moving subjects in dim light, but this one keeps up in most situations.

Much of the 16E is familiar, but there is one entirely new component: Apple’s C1 modem. This is its debut appearance, and the road to Apple’s first in-house modem was reportedly full of setbacks and delays. I’ve used it for the past week to make FaceTime calls, upload large video files in crowded places, and stream YouTube on the bus. I tested it alongside a regular iPhone 16 equipped with a Qualcomm-made modem — both on Verizon — and I didn’t see any consistent difference in performance between the two.

Every time I thought the iPhone 16 was faring better with video call quality or upload speeds, I’d try the same test again and the 16E would come out ahead. If I were none the wiser, I wouldn’t have given the modem a second thought as I used the phone. Given the difficulty Apple seemingly encountered building this thing and the complexity of a cellular modem, “it seems fine” is actually a great outcome for the C1.

Apple claims switching to its own modem has allowed it to squeeze a little more battery life out of the 16E, offering “the best battery life ever on a 6.1-inch iPhone,” according to its press release. Battery life certainly seems good. I spent an afternoon out of the house using a lot of navigation, streaming a podcast, testing connectivity, and watching YouTube. I clocked about five hours of screen time and was only down to 41 percent by the end of the day. I’m confident that most people could get through a day comfortably on this battery, but that’s not my biggest concern. I’m more curious about long-term battery health — Apple’s recent track record here is spotty — and there’s just no way of knowing that after a week of testing.

The 16E only comes in black or white, but at least this fuchsia case is hot.

The other upgrade here is Apple Intelligence. Maybe you’ve heard of it? Or seen it on a billboard? Or in a commercial a few dozen times? Apple would like us to think of its AI as a marquee feature on the 16E, but Apple Intelligence just doesn’t feel like one — not yet, anyway. But it’s all here: the AI writing tools, Image Playground, notification summaries, and the updated Siri with a ChatGPT extension. It’s all pretty forgettable right now.

Case in point: it took me several days to notice that Apple Intelligence wasn’t running on the 16E I was testing, despite having the Apple Intelligence option turned on. I sorted it out — I guess something about the way I set it up prevented the necessary AI models from downloading — but this says a lot about how useful Apple Intelligence is right now. The most interesting stuff is yet to come, and the 16E will be ready for it, which is nice. But I definitely wouldn’t let Apple Intelligence be a deciding factor in picking this phone versus, say, an iPhone 15.

The 16E makes more sense if you think Apple Intelligence is an essential feature.

That highlights where I’m stuck trying to figure out the 16E. If you’re coming from an older iPhone like an 11, don’t want to spend a lot, and don’t care about MagSafe or an ultrawide camera, then the 16E kind of makes sense. But a hundred dollars more will get you a new iPhone 15 with MagSafe, the Dynamic Island, and an ultrawide camera, though there’s no Apple Intelligence or action button.

The 16E feels like it should offer the essentials, but it’s hard to say what’s an essential iPhone feature and what’s not. It’s probably more like a combination of features, and for some people, the 16E likely offers a combination they’ll be happy with. Specifically, I mean people like my husband and anyone else with an old iPhone who is uninterested in learning what MagSafe is, rarely takes pictures, and just wants a dang iPhone. The 16E covers those essentials. For someone who wants more flexibility from their smartphone’s camera or its system of accessories, this isn’t the iPhone for you.

I’d rather have a cool magnetic accessory system and a neat quick-glance display feature built into my phone than Apple Intelligence, especially for $600. It doesn’t quite add up for me, but maybe the math looks a little different for you.",0.9997,0.042,0.819,0.14
Apple,Apple will let parents share their kids’ ages to limit app access,"Apple announced in a whitepaper that it plans to introduce a bunch of new child safety features, including letting parents share their kids’ age ranges with apps, refreshing the App Store’s age ratings system, and making it easier for parents to set up Child …",https://www.theverge.com/news/621195/apple-parents-kids-accounts-share-age-ranges,2025-02-27,"is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.

Apple announced in a whitepaper that it plans to introduce a bunch of new child safety features, including letting parents share their kids’ age ranges with apps, refreshing the App Store’s age ratings system, and making it easier for parents to set up Child Accounts for their kids. The company says it will introduce the features “this year.”

Companies like Meta, Snap, and X have called for platforms to be responsible for verifying the ages of users at the OS or app store level. Apple also reportedly lobbied against a proposed bill in Louisiana that would have required the company to enforce age restrictions.

In the whitepaper, Apple argues that age verification “at the app marketplace level” wouldn’t be ideal, as it would require users to hand over “sensitive personally identifying information” to the company. “That’s not in the interest of user safety or privacy,” Apple says.

The age sharing system gestures in that direction without going so far as to fully verify each user’s age. With the age range feature, “parents can allow their kids to share the age range associated with their Child Accounts with app developers,” Apple says.

The age range will “be shared with developers if and only if parents decide to allow this information to be shared,” and parents will be able to disable sharing. The feature also won’t “provide kids’ actual birthdates.” Developers will be able to request the age ranges with a new API that Apple says is a “narrowly tailored, data-minimizing, privacy-protecting tool to assist app developers who can benefit from it.”

“Today’s announcement is a positive first step, however, developers can only apply these age-appropriate protections with a teen’s approval,” Meta spokesperson Jamie Radice says in a statement to The Verge. “Parents tell us they want to have the final say over the apps their teens use, and that’s why we support legislation that requires app stores to verify a child’s age and get a parent’s approval before their child downloads an app.”

As for App Store ratings will expand from four thresholds to five; the new categories will be Age 4 plus, 9 plus, 13 plus, 16 plus, and 18 plus. In their app listings, developers will be asked to highlight “whether apps contain user-generated content or advertising capabilities that can impact the presence of age-inappropriate content” and if apps have their own content controls.

Apple says that the App Store won’t show kids apps with age ratings “in the places where we feature apps on our storefront” that are higher than what their parents set on their accounts.

As for Child Accounts, Apple says that it will introduce a new setup process and let parents fix the age associated with the account if it wasn’t set up correctly.

Apple,Apple iPhone 16e Review: Questionable Value,Apple’s latest $599 iPhone isn’t the best bang for your buck.,https://www.wired.com/review/apple-iphone-16e/,2025-02-27,"The iPhone 16e isn't for me. If you're an avid tech enthusiast and Apple fan, it's probably not for you either. It's for the person holding on to an iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X, ready to upgrade because their more than seven-year-old smartphone isn't working too well nowadays. They want a new phone, and it just needs to be an iPhone.

A part of my brain won't stop thinking about whether this nearly once-in-a-decade upgrade for these folks wouldn't be better served if Apple had included its nice-to-have amenities, like MagSafe or the ultra-wideband chip for improved AirTags tracking. Even lacking these features, the price of the iPhone 16e feels $100 too high considering the many excellent competing phones in this bracket. It also makes the iPhone lineup confusing—it's $170 more than Apple's previous iPhone SE that's no longer available.

I have spent much of my time this past week using the iPhone 16e and thinking about its $599 MSRP, which naturally must mean that something is awry. This may not matter much to people in the US, who favor purchasing through carriers that subsidize the cost, though they're still paying for a $600 (locked) phone spread over a few years. But when the used iPhone marketplace is healthy and thriving, it feels as though anyone considering an iPhone 16e will find better value with an iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro.

Cell Boost

The best iPhone 16e feature? Battery life. Considering this is a 6.1-inch iPhone, which historically perform the lowest in battery tests, this is a welcome surprise. With average use over the past week, I struggled to bring the phone below 50 percent. (It usually hovered around 51 or 49 percent by bedtime.) Yes, that means the iPhone 16e has better battery life than the iPhone 16.

On one particular day when I used it for GPS navigation, music streaming, and picture snapping, it was left with around 30 percent before bed. And another busy day, I hit nearly nine hours of screen-on time and had 15 percent in the tank. That's excellent. It's still not the best iPhone battery life in the lineup—that'd be the iPhone 16 Pro Max and iPhone 16 Plus—but it's enough to keep that battery anxiety at bay when you're out and about.

Apple claims this battery boost is in part thanks to the first-ever Apple-designed C1 modem inside the phone. Apple spent years building this connectivity chip to reduce its reliance on partners like Qualcomm, and it seems to have paid off. I didn't experience any issues with cellular connectivity over the past week with the AT&T eSIM Apple provided, though this also could depend on region. (I'm in New York City.) I ran speed tests via Ookla on various phones alongside the iPhone 16e and did not find anything out of the ordinary. That said, remember Antennagate? We'll have to wait and see how the C1 modem performs in the hands of far more people across the world.",0.9934,0.034,0.845,0.121
Apple,Apple’s Dictation App Is Mistaking the Word ‘Racist’ for ‘Trump’,"Apple has claimed that the bug is the result of ""phonetic overlap.""",https://gizmodo.com/apples-dictation-app-is-mistaking-the-word-racist-for-trump-2000568413,2025-02-26,"A recently discovered bug in iPhone’s dictation app caused it to swap out the word “Trump” for “racist,” in a development that is sure to have liberals chortling and conservatives fuming.

The issue was first noted by users of TikTok and other social media sites, who found that when they said the word “racist,” the app would instead briefly deliver the name of our current president, as Variety first reported. Apple has since confirmed that its app does sometimes confuse one word with another. “We are aware of an issue with the speech recognition model that powers Dictation and we are rolling out a fix today,” an Apple representative told Variety.

How does Apple explain this bizarre mixup? The company has claimed that its speech-recognition feature “may temporarily display words with some phonetic overlap before landing on the correct word.” Theoretically, that makes sense but I think it’s somewhat questionable how much Trump’s name and “racist” have in common phonetically. Variety claims that its own tests “indicate that other words that can produce ‘trump’ include ‘ramp,’ ‘rhubarb,’ ‘rhythmic’ and ‘ruffles.'” A broad overall takeaway could just be that Apple’s dictation app sucks. Notably, Apple has been gradually integrating AI with its products.

One TikTok influencer account noted that she had been able to reproduce the bug at least twice, and provided a video of the transcription jumping from “Trump” to “racist.” “How do they do that? That’s scary,” she says, in the video.

Gizmodo reached out to Apple for comment and more information on the bug.

This is sure to do little to assuage concerns by conservatives that Big Tech is out to get them. Even though—since the election—the tech industry has overwhelmingly stepped up to kiss Trump’s ass, conservatives have long suspected that the tech oligarchy is not on their side. For the most part, tech’s perceived slights against the MAGA world have been palpable, if notably small fry. Previous scandals involved an election-related incident last summer when Amazon Alexa was caught encouraging voters to vote for Kamala Harris but couldn’t give similar reasons for Trump, and Google’s much-maligned AI image generator, which kicked off the whole “Black vikings” debacle.",-0.9837,0.105,0.856,0.039

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.

YouTube isn’t a podcast app, but that hasn’t stopped it from becoming the number one place people who want to consume online radio shows now turn to. According to the company, a staggering 1 billion people are tuning into podcasts every month on YouTube. That’s not just more than either Apple or Spotify can claim — it utterly lays them to waste.

In 2023, Spotify reported it had 100 million regular podcast listeners, and touted that half a billion people had listened to a podcast on its platform since 2019 when it started its push into the world of online radio shows. Apple tends to come out behind Spotify in third-party measurements. If a full eighth of the world’s population uses YouTube for podcasts, it seems like that’s probably where the action is.

Reaching that big chunk of audience takes extra work for podcasters, though. Listeners can’t turn just off their phone’s screen to listen unless they’re paying for YouTube Premium, and people may not want to stare at a static image for an hour straight. That means doing video to really make it count.

Making video for YouTube is far more expensive than it used to be. In a newsletter earlier this month, cooking creator Carla Lalli Music, formerly of Bon Apetit, said it cost her $3,500 to shoot a single video for the platform. Those were more complicated than a podcast video, but it still speaks to the platform’s demand for quality in order to get off the ground. YouTube says that more than 400 million hours of podcasts were watched on TVs alone last year. Video clearly matters; creators can’t just turn on their webcams and get results.

Reaching YouTube’s audience also means playing by YouTube’s rules. The platform doesn’t work with RSS feeds in the same way that most other podcast platforms do — every podcast has to become a native YouTube video. That requires them to play by YouTube’s ad rules, too, and use YouTube’s ad systems. Podcasters can’t serve ads the same way they do everywhere else, and they can’t get the same metrics they’d normally use to sell advertisers on their reach and success.

Still, that tradeoff has clearly been worth it to a great many creators, and YouTube’s stats today show why. It may not be a traditional podcast platform, but it’s a big one that podcasters can’t ignore.",0.9655,0.042,0.867,0.091

Reuters

Apple says it is working to fix its speech-to-text tool after some social media users found that when they spoke the word ""racist"" into their iPhones it typed it out as ""Trump."" The tech giant has suggested the issue with its Dictation service has been caused by a problem it has distinguishing between words with an ""r"" in them. ""We are aware of an issue with the speech recognition model that powers Dictation and we are rolling out a fix today,"" an Apple spokesperson said. However an expert in speech recognition told the BBC this explanation was ""just not plausible."" Peter Bell, professor of speech technology at the University of Edinburgh, said it was more likely that someone had altered the underlying software that the tool used.

Videos shared online show people speaking the word ""racist"" into the Dictation tool. Sometimes it is transcribed correctly - but on other occasions it is turned into ""Trump"", before being quickly restored to the correct word. The BBC has not been able to replicate the mistake, suggesting Apple's fix is already taking effect. Prof Bell said Apple's explanation of phonetic overlap did not make sense because the two words were not similar enough to confuse an artificial intelligence (AI) system. Speech-to-text recognition models are trained by inputting clips of real people speaking alongside an accurate transcript of what they say. They are also taught to understand words in context - for example, they could distinguish the word ""cup"" from ""cut"" if it was within the phrase ""a cup of tea"". Prof Bell says the situation with Apple is unlikely to be a genuine mistake with its data because its English language model would be trained on hundreds of thousands of hours of speech, which should give it a high level of accuracy. For ""less well-resourced languages"" he said it could be an AI training issue. But he said in this case: ""it probably points to somebody that's got access to the process."" A former Apple employee who worked on its AI assistant Siri told the New York Times: ""This smells like a serious prank.""",-0.34,0.055,0.895,0.049

Beyond just being premium earbuds, they’re now pioneering hearing health features with clinical-grade protection and testing capabilities, making them more than just a way to listen to your favorite tunes.

See at Amazon

Amazon’s slashed the price of these next-gen earbuds to $199, down from their usual $249 price tag. This 20% discount matches previous all-time lows, making it an excellent time to upgrade your audio game.

Why AirPods Pro 2

The standout feature has to be the improved Active Noise Cancellation, which now blocks up to twice as much background noise as the previous generation. Pair that with the new Adaptive Audio that automatically adjusts to your environment, and you’ve got earbuds that actually understand your surroundings.

Sound quality gets a significant boost thanks to the H2 chip and custom-built drivers, delivering those crisp highs and deep bass you’d expect from premium earbuds. For calls, the Voice Isolation feature makes sure you come through crystal clear, even in noisy environments.

Battery life is solid – you’re looking at 6 hours of listening time with noise cancellation on, and the case adds another 24 hours. Speaking of the case, it’s now IP54 dust and water-resistant (just like the buds), and includes some neat features like Precision Finding and a built-in speaker to help you locate misplaced earbuds.

The fit is more customizable than ever, with four tip sizes (XS to L) included in the box. This matters because a good seal is crucial for both sound quality and the effectiveness of features like noise cancellation and the new personalized Spatial Audio. That makes it sound like you’re center stage, right in front, at the show, with everyone getting absorbed in the music all around you. But you’re just in your living room.

For iOS users, these earbuds integrate seamlessly with your devices, offering conveniences like automatic device switching and hands-free Siri access – you can even respond to Siri with head gestures now. At $199, while still premium-priced, you’re getting some of the most advanced earbuds on the market with features that justify the investment.

So if you’re ready to level up your earbud game, you really can’t do much better than AirPods Pro 2, especially while they’re on sale at this price point. Now’s your chance to lock a pair in, so be sure to do so before they’re gone for good at this discount.

It works both ways too – if your phone is the thing that’s gone missing, double-pressing the Tile button will make your phone ring, even when it’s on silent.

Battery life is a strong point here, with up to three years of use before needing a replacement. The device is also water-resistant with an IP68 rating, meaning it can handle rain, splashes, and brief submersion without issue.

One of the Tile Mate’s standout features is its integration with Life360, allowing families to keep track of both items and loved ones on a single map. This ecosystem approach makes it particularly valuable for households already using Life360 for family coordination.

The new SOS feature adds an extra layer of personal safety, letting users discreetly alert loved ones in uncomfortable or dangerous situations. This transforms the Tile Mate from a simple item finder into a potential safety device.

Cross-platform compatibility means it works seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, making it a practical choice for mixed-device households. The free Tile app provides a straightforward interface for managing all your tracked items.

At $18, the Tile Mate represents an affordable entry point into the world of item tracking. Whether you’re frequently misplacing your keys, want to safeguard valuable items, or need a reliable way to keep tabs on family belongings, this discounted price makes it an appealing option for both first-time users and those looking to expand their existing Tile network.

If you’re someone who loses things often and needs a nudge in the right direction to make sure you can keep track of them, this tracker is for you.

Apple has acknowledged a peculiar bug with the iPhone’s dictation feature that briefly displays “Trump” when someone says the word “racist.” The Verge has been unable to reproduce the issue, but it picked up attention on Tuesday after a video demonstrating the strange substitution went viral on TikTok and other social media.

The company provided a statement to The New York Times and Fox News confirming the bug. “We are aware of an issue with the speech recognition model that powers dictation, and we are rolling out a fix as soon as possible,” an unnamed spokesperson said, according to Fox News.

Apparently the issue boils down to phonetic overlap between “Trump” and “racist.” The company told Fox News that other words with an “r” consonant are also occasionally affected. But John Burkey, who formerly worked on the Siri team at Apple, told the Times that Trump’s name appearing “smells like a serious prank” that could have been purposefully carried out by someone internally.

Regardless of the technical reason behind it, the awkward glitch comes a day after Apple announced plans to invest more than $500 billion in the United States over the next four years. The company is looking to blunt the potential impact of tariffs put into place by President Donald Trump, with a 10 percent tariff already in effect on goods imported from China, and a 25 percent tariff threatened for chips.",-0.1927,0.04,0.93,0.03
