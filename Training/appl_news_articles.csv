Apple fixed a bug in the iOS 18.2 Passwords app that, for three months starting with the release of iOS 18, made users vulnerable to phishing attacks, according to an Apple security content update spotted by 9to5Mac.

Here’s how Apple describes the bug and its fix:

Impact: A user in a privileged network position may be able to leak sensitive information Description: This issue was addressed by using HTTPS when sending information over the network.

As 9to5Mac writes, the Passwords app was sending unencrypted requests for the logos and icons it shows next to the sites your stored passwords are associated with. The lack of encryption meant an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network as you, like at an airport or coffee shop, could redirect your browser to a look-a-like phishing site to steal your login credentials. It was first discovered by security researchers at app developer Mysk.

In the description of the below YouTube video demonstrating the bug, Mysk writes that it first reported the vulnerability in September. Apple describes the same bug in security content updates for the Mac, iPad, and the Vision Pro, as well."

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.

Apple TV Plus is losing more than $1 billion every year despite reaching 45 million subscribers in 2024, according to a report from The Information. It’s reportedly the only Apple subscription that isn’t generating a profit.

As part of an effort to take “a harder line on spending,” Apple cut its initial $5 billion budget for Apple TV Plus content by around $500 million, The Information reports. Even with hit original shows like Severance, Apple TV currently captures less than 1 percent of total monthly streaming services viewership, as opposed to Netflix’s 8.2 percent, according to data from Nielsen cited by The Information.

But, as noted by The Information, Apple TV Plus was largely created to keep people in the Apple ecosystem. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos touched on the strategy behind Apple TV Plus during an interview with Variety this week, saying “I don’t understand it beyond a marketing play, but they’re really smart people. Maybe they see something we don’t,” he said.

Apple TV Plus is part of the company’s broader services business, which makes Apple billions of dollars each year through iCloud Plus, App Store purchases, and search advertising. Sources also told The Information that Apple Music, which reportedly reached 100 million users on subscriptions and free trials last year, has seen a slowdown in growth.

Apple News Plus, Fitness Plus, and Apple Arcade also “struggle with low usage and profits,” while sales of digital books have taken a dip as well, The Information reports. Sources tell the outlet that if these services weren’t included in the company’s Apple One bundle, which people mostly buy for iCloud Plus, they “likely wouldn’t be profitable.” Apple reportedly laid off around 100 people in its News and Books division last year.

The Verge reached out to Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back."
Apple,Opening iOS is good news for smartwatches,"Look at every smartwatch buying guide on the internet. I guarantee they’re either divided into separate guides for iOS and Android, like The Verge’s, or include categories like “Best for iPhone owners” or “Best for Android.” (Also, like The Verge’s fitness tr…",https://www.theverge.com/news/633765/ios-eu-interoperability-smartwatches-headphones,2025-03-21T15:46:04Z,"Look at every smartwatch buying guide on the internet. I guarantee they’re either divided into separate guides for iOS and Android, like The Verge’s, or include categories like “Best for iPhone owners” or “Best for Android.” (Also, like The Verge’s fitness tracker guide.) It wasn’t always this way.

Five years ago, you could buy a Samsung or Fossil smartwatch and use it with an iPhone. The problem was it was never quite as good. Apple Watches were superior, not only because they could seamlessly connect with your Mac and AirPods, but you could also send quick replies to texts. Other third-party smartwatches couldn’t do all that.

Losing the ability to interact with other devices was hardly a deal breaker — it’s not that hard to go through the regular Bluetooth pairing process. But most people view smartwatches as an easy way to stay connected without glancing at their phones. Losing quick replies because you might prefer the look or features of a third-party device? For many people, it’s a tradeoff that doesn’t make sense. For years, I’d ask device makers why this feature wasn’t available. Every single time, from companies large and small, the answer was that Apple didn’t allow it. So, I was hardly surprised when Android smartwatch makers started kissing iOS goodbye in 2021 with Wear OS 3. In the years since, the number of platform-agnostic wearable makers continues to dwindle.

This is a big reason why it’s a good thing that the European Commission recently gave Apple marching orders to open up iOS interoperability to other gadget makers. You can read our explainer on the nitty gritty of what this means, but the gist is that it’s going to be harder for Apple to gatekeep iOS features to its own products. Specific to smartwatches, Apple will have to allow third-party smartwatch makers to display and interact with iOS notifications. I’m certain Garmin fans worldwide, who have long complained about the inability to send quick replies on iOS, erupted in cheers.

Apple, and at least one tech publication, has decried this decision as hindering Apple’s ability to innovate. In a statement, Apple spokesperson Marni Goldberg told The Verge that it will force the company to “give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules.”

But the last few years have been fairly lackluster for smartwatch innovation. Samsung blatantly copied Apple in its 2024 smartwatch lineup with the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch FE. Google has mostly stuck to refining the Pixel Watch. Apple introduced an Ultra model in 2022, but otherwise, last year’s Series 10 was another iterative update. The Ultra 2 only got a new color. (Even though that color was sick as hell.) In the wearables world, smartwatches are kind of… just there.

These days, I receive far more queries about smart rings and smart glasses — because everyone knows that if you have an iPhone, you get an Apple Watch, and if you have an Android, you get a Galaxy Watch or a Pixel Watch. (Maybe a OnePlus Watch 2 or 3 if you really care about battery.) If you’re an endurance athlete, you get a Garmin. There’s not much incentive for any of these companies to zhuzh up designs or think out of the box when ecosystem lock-in all but ensures they don’t have to. There’s no urgency. The result is smartwatches have become boring as we wait for the next Big Health Feature to get FDA clearance. I long for the weird, frenetic excitement of 2014-2020 era smartwatches. Instead, I have a hard time believing 2025 smartwatches will be much different from last year’s. (For the record, I would love to be proven wrong.)

Fans of walled gardens have to admit it doesn’t always work out. The Powerbeats Pro 2 ought to be a cautionary tale of how the “it just works” philosophy can backfire. Despite being an Apple product, Android users actually have more choice when it comes to how they use the Pro 2. On iOS, the heart rate feature is limited to seven apps and users must choose between monitoring heart rate or listening to tunes when connected to gym equipment. Android users have no such limitations. Do the Powerbeats Pro 2 work more seamlessly on the iOS apps it does support? Yes. But that’s not important to everyone. Some people just want the ability to choose how they use the products they buy.

The bottom line is the EU’s move improves a consumer’s ability to pick the best smartwatch for their needs regardless of their phone. There’s no reason a grizzled marathoner who prizes in-depth training metrics, free coaching plans, and monthlong battery life should have to get an Apple Watch Ultra over a Garmin just because they also want to have quick replies. I’ll admit that it is mind-numbingly convenient and pleasant to stay in one ecosystem. But if the Apple Watch is truly the best smartwatch out there, it should be able to defend that title even if third parties have access to iOS notifications."
Apple,8 TV Shows and Movies to Watch After You Finish Severance,"Hopefully it won't be another long gap between seasons for the Apple TV+ series, but you're definitely going to have some time to fill.",https://gizmodo.com/what-to-watch-if-you-like-severance-streaming-2000577595,2025-03-19T16:15:38Z,"The Severance season two finale is this week, making this both a thrilling and devastating moment for its devoted fans. Finally, some answers (maybe?) about all those lingering mysteries! But also, the end of our weekly supply of Lumon-induced drama, romance, freakiness, and quirky comedy, until such time as a yet-to-be-confirmed third season arrives! To help your tempers recalibrate when Severance wraps up, here are eight TV shows and movies that might help fill the yawning void it will leave behind.

Dark Matter

You don’t even have to exit the Apple TV+ app for Dark Matter. It’s based on Blake Crouch’s book about a man who unwittingly dives into the ultimate “what if?” scenario when he’s kidnapped by a different version of himself, then forced into an unfamiliar version of his life’s timeline. Like Severance, it explores themes of how wildly divergent personalities can evolve from a single person—and involves weird tech that seems like a pretty cool invention until the horrible consequences start making themselves known. Joel Edgerton is less endearing of a hero than Severance‘s Adam Scott, but you’ll still want to root for him to reunite with his beloved, played by Jennifer Connelly. The first season is available for streaming now; a second season is on the way.

Devs

Do you long for more workplace weirdness after all those Lumon elevator rides? Devs, created, written, and directed by Alex Garland (who’s best-known for his big-screen credits: Ex Machina, Annihilation, Civil War, the upcoming 28 Years Later) takes place at a mysterious tech company with sci-fi leanings (much like Severance) and involves a murder mystery (also much like Severance). It also has the Severance-like quality of boasting a killer cast, including Nick Offerman, Sonoya Mizuno, Cailee Spaeny, Alison Pill, and others. You can watch its eight-episode single season on Hulu.

Black Mirror

Quite obviously, Black Mirror and Severance have some thematic echoes, chief among them that tech can be scary—especially if its inventor or wielder has cult-like aspirations and/or fancies themselves to be a god. Just as Severance season two began to wrap up, Netflix announced the star-studded seventh season of Charlie Brooker’s dystopian standard-bearer will drop April 10. You can also stream the previous six Black Mirror seasons in case you want to experience something bleaker than our current reality in the meantime.

Westworld

At this point, it’s less and less likely we’ll ever get that fifth season Westworld‘s creators have teased in the past. But really, the four seasons we did get remain some of sci-fi television’s finest hours, exploring a world where robots are so lifelike their AI slips into the realm of the fully sentient—with the added bonus of imaginative settings (a Wild West playground for rich people, a futuristic city where humans have fallen under robot control) and an incredible cast, including Evan Rachel Wood, Jeffrey Wright, and Thandiwe Newton. The only thing we can fault Westworld for isn’t the doing of the show itself; HBO yanked it from streaming a few years back, so you’ll have to fork out extra dollars to rent or buy it on streaming (Prime Video has it), or purchase the complete series on Blu-ray, DVD, or 4K UHD.

Fingernails

Jessie Buckley, Jeremy Allen White, Luke Wilson, and Riz Ahmed star in this offbeat sci-fi romance—made for Apple TV+—set in a world where technology has supposedly cracked the formula of true love. Adding to the Severance factor, it’s actually set within the awkward confines of the Love Institute, the company that administers the test. When Buckley’s character takes a job there, she soon begins to question her own relationship, as well as whether or not the Love Institute is actually helping or hurting people.

Coherence

A group of friends and frenemies gather for a dinner party the night a comet just happens to be passing through the night sky—and reality jumbles as a result, with versions of the guests wandering in from different parallel realities. It’s a gripping sci-fi thriller that proves you don’t need a big budget or even more than one set, really, to tell an entertainingly original story, and it’s also perfect viewing for anyone who found themselves second-guessing Severance‘s Helena/Helly R. twist. Coherence is widely available on streaming, including Peacock and Prime Video.

The One I Love

Doppelgangers—the classic physically separate kind, unlike Severance‘s one body/multiple minds variety—complicate this tale of a couple (Mark Duplass, Elisabeth Moss) whose attempt to mend their relationship with a romantic getaway takes a very surreal twist. Ted Danson, who makes everything better, plays their therapist. Streaming free with ads on Prime Video.

Bliss

Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek star in this Prime Video feature from Mike Cahill (Another Earth, I Origins) that puts a romantic spin on a classic sci-fi plot: what if everything you think is real is just a simulation? Bliss also offers a thoughtful exploration of what it means to appreciate what you have in life—while also learning to accept the grimier stuff you’d rather just delete with the ease of a keystroke. Streaming on Prime Video.

Honorable mention: Made for Love

This sci-fi series that ran on what was then HBO Max in 2021-2022 starred Cristin Milioti (The Penguin, Black Mirror) as a woman whose attempts to escape her dysfunctional marriage to an eccentric tech billionaire (Billy Magnussem) are complicated by the fact that she has a chip designed to spy on every aspect of her life, including her emotions, implanted in her brain. Made for Love was delightfully original and would absolutely fit in with a Severance-adjacent streaming binge, except it’s no longer available on Max— and is in fact not streaming legally anywhere. It also, frustratingly, never got a physical media release."

Since joining in 2021, her work has won ASME design and American Illustration awards.

When asked what they do for work, creative couple Jessie Char and Maxwell Neely-Cohen should probably just say “yes.” True professional multihyphenates, Char’s gig history includes stints as a UI/UX designer, conference organizer, concert cellist, and Apple Genius; Neely-Cohen is a novelist, ballet dancer, and coeditor of the experimental literary journal The HTML Review. Together, they’ve built everything from a real-life version of Cher Horowitz’s Clueless closet to the sound design of a play with over 200 original sound cues.

I asked them for a tour of the tech in their Williamsburg, Brooklyn, loft, where they regularly host literary salons, violin performances, and film industry mixers. We chatted about their shared reverence for old hardware, live coding, how they find comedy in sound, and why they’ll never install a smart light switch.

Max selects a record from the couple’s well-organized vinyl collection using a pair of multisided dice. The couple developed a game where house rules dictate whatever record is pulled must be played from start to finish.

How did you two meet?

Max Neely-Cohen: It was at a Zoom reading group at the very beginning of the pandemic. We were reading Expanded Cinema [by Gene Youngblood] with a group of mostly designers and artists.

Jessie Char: The book was about the early history of computer art and animation.

And then what? Someone slid into the other’s DMs?

MNC: First we stayed long on the Zoom call—

JC: Until everybody peeled off and then it was just us. So, we hung out on Zoom for a few hours, and then I slid into his DMs on Instagram right after.

MNC: I mean, she beat me by seconds.

JC: But there is another cute thing, which is the Color Chat app.

MNC: It’s this really cool art project where you could only communicate with each other by sending color swatches. You would select from this big rainbow wheel, and then it would send it and it would name the color. And I would send a lot of unintentionally flirty colors. I swear to God, I sent one that was “lipstick red” and then another that was just “passionate fire.” But it was also accurate. So, we would kind of joke about it, but it was also extremely real flirting.

The first-floor bathroom’s tunes are played via an iPod connected to 2004 Harman Kardon SoundSticks speakers.

And then Jessie, who was living in San Francisco, moved to New York?

JC: The first time I visited Max was November of 2020, and I was supposed to stay for a couple of weeks, but there was another covid wave, so I didn’t want to fly. And basically, I just stayed forever.

What were you both up to creatively at the time?

JC: I was in the middle of losing my career. I used to produce a design conference that took place at the same time as Apple’s developer conference, WWDC. It was the kind of little sister conference of WWDC. And [when covid hit], obviously conferences stopped happening. So I was kind of floating through life trying to figure out what to do next. [I was] still doing design contract work, but I had kind of lost my big thing. I was still freelancing, but it wasn’t anything fun. I actually can’t remember the first creative thing that I did when I came to New York.

MNC: It was live coding.

Tell me about that.

MNC: It’s this still-emerging practice where you can perform music, visual art, all sorts of things, through writing code and executing it onstage. If you really think about it, all music involves manipulating machines that the audience mostly doesn’t know and understand. Like, I don’t know how a saxophone works. So this is a similar thing, where you’re basically up there with these custom-made languages that make everything faster, performing music with the code you’re writing.

A mechanical keyboard fan. Max has an array of keyboard caps. On a shelf in the kitchen is a painting of their cat, Detective Blueberry, by Jessie, who is also a wonderful cook. The couple enjoy hosting gatherings, often with friends and collaborators.

How did you both learn to code?

JC: In the GeoCities days, pre-Neopets HTML, is what we’re talking about. As an adult, even though I was living in the Bay Area and working in tech, I never actually coded for work or fun really. It was just this thing that I knew how to do from when I was a kid.

MNC: I didn’t ever code for any other reason than that I wanted to make a weird thing, and then it evolved to learning how to do weird projection art, and I just needed to learn different things for very specific projects.

JC: And I was making Spice Girls fan pages [as a kid].

MNC: Live code was kind of my first foray back into learning a new coding language. Kind of remembering that I have this framework for how to program things.

Which coding language?

MNC: ORCA.

Like the whale?

MNC: Like the whale.

JC: And I really wanted to impress Max. So I learned a programming language to impress him—

MNC: She learned it within days.

Max’s collection of synthesizers. An homage to Nam June Paik’s “TV Garden” sits under the stairs at the edge of the living room. Images on the CRT TVs are responsive to the sounds created at the console to its left.

How did you transition from live coding to working as sound designers in theater?

JC: The writers strike.

MNC: Yeah, because of all the strikes. We didn’t know what would happen with the directors guild at that point. A lot of our friends, who were mostly working in TV and film but were trained in theater, started getting jazzed about theater projects because [the writers strike didn’t affect theater]. So our dear friend Maia [Novi] came to us and said, “I have a play. I want you all to sound design it.”

JC: She was like, “You’re both good at computers and music.” And we had no idea [what sound design was]. We were like, “Yeah, we’ll get some bug sound effects and play them on a laptop.” We had no idea how the process worked, what the software was, but we kind of figured it all out on the job and really fooled everybody into believing in our competence. Since that first run of Invasive Species, where we had no idea what we were doing, we’ve basically been working in theater nonstop for the past two years.

So how did you approach the sound for Invasive Species? What did that process actually look like?

JC: I think that Max and I have the tendency to take things to their absolute furthest ends when we have the means to do it. So instead of it just being the sound effect of a bug flying around, it turned into basically a fully scored play where we wrote an underscore for the whole thing.

What’s an underscore?

MNC: Just music that plays underneath the play. It isn’t just one-hit sound effects, like a door slamming or whatever. It’s music that the actors would kind of choreograph themselves to and work with, and [it requires] sophisticated queuing setups, which is kind of a form of programming in QLab.

How long did it take you to write?

MNC: Two weeks.

You wrote the whole score of a show in two weeks? Is that normal?

JC: Theater is normally pretty fast, but we didn’t know any better. And I think, realistically, a typical sound designer probably does about 1/20th of what we ended up putting out because we just didn’t know what the world expected of this. We just went really, really hard.

How are you assembling the sound that gets included? Are you making music? Are you sampling?

MNC: Yeah, all of it. We were mostly making music through every way available to us. This is a little different from Jessie, but my most successful things as a theatrical sound designer have been the things I’ve made as jokes that then end up in the show.

A homemade cardboard tank for Detective Blueberry. Detective Blueberry fan art.

Does it feel funny in the show or does it feel like it’s a joke that only you get?

MNC: No, it’s not that it’s a joke in the show. It’s just that, in whatever rehearsal and then tech process, I’m like, “Wouldn’t it be funny if I made this?” And at that moment, I don’t know if it’s actually going to be good, right?

JC: But there is a lot of comedy in the sound. I think that we do have a sense for how to infuse a very specific type of comedy into the sound design. It’s not like it’s a rubber chicken and spring boingy sounds; it’s not cartoonish in any way. But I think that the sound design is able to capture a lot more of the writing and storytelling.

So you’re doing a lot of theater work together. Are you collaborating in other ways?

JC: I want to say yes, but I have to think of what collaborations are. Aside from our entire lives together.

Jessie and Max worked with Automatic Audio in Montreal to customize their sound system.

Let’s talk about your individual creative interests. Max, you have two highly specific titles on your resume: a fellow at the Harvard Law School Library Innovation Lab and a consulting dramaturge at the New York Choreographic Institute at the New York City Ballet. You should probably start by telling me what a dramaturge is.

MNC: It’s a great question. A dramaturge in dance, opera, or theater is a person who helps develop the themes and narrative qualities of the piece, kind of across departments. Particularly in dance or opera, there isn’t the same relationship between director and writer. There are all these departments making all this art, and it can be really helpful to have someone who’s almost taking on the mantle of: What is the audience going to see? What are they going to take from this, and how does that affect the story and its structure?

Tell me about your approach to technology in your home.

JC: We are really specific about it, aren’t we?

MNC: Yeah. We hate any smart home things. We banned them.

Many of Max and Jessie’s retro gaming devices are still in working order. A Tetris power user, Jessie has her Game Boy models and the original Tetris game cartridge in the couple’s vintage collection.

What do you dislike about smart home tech?

JC: I think that with the rise of the internet and Wi-Fi, a lot of companies that make software rely on the fact that they can just keep releasing updates. And I don’t want to have to do a software update on my light switches or my refrigerator. I just really like things that are guaranteed to work and are fixable because I know how to do hardware repairs — I have certifications for it — and I like knowing that if something isn’t working properly, I can personally address the issue. But so many smart home devices are proprietary; they are inaccessible, and that worries me a little bit.

MNC: Yeah, we were not going to buy toilets that we could not fix ourselves.

JC: Because toilets are technology!

MNC: Likewise, the speakers we have, we wanted to make sure that we could always open them up and solder the wires back together. Which is not true of a Bose soundbar.

JC: I just see technology as a really wonderful tool. I don’t see it as an assistant, and I think that’s the kind of distinction that I like making. Anything that I can use as a tool, I absolutely love, and anything that’s trying to help me in some way isn’t as useful to me.

An homage to Nam June Paik’s “TV Garden” sits under the stairs at the edge of the living room. Images on the CRT TVs are responsive to the sounds created at the console to its left.

Tell me about your TV garden and your synthesizer library.

MNC: It was an evolution that began in the last apartment we lived in, which started before we met when I wanted to put all the instruments I owned on one rack. So, the first version was actually a beat-up dish drying rack from a supermarket that got discarded. The setup we have now is driven by this principle of being able to flip one switch and everything turns on. We can use it for professional stuff, but an eight-year-old kid can also start making sound with it right away.

It’s a place for play.

MNC: It’s a place for play. And the TVs were a way for us to have this little visual synthesizer in a fun way. Given the space under the stairs, we didn’t want it to just be a bunch of televisions on the floor, so we designed it as an homage to Nam June Paik’s “TV Garden.”

The suit targets Apple ads that showed off ‌Siri‌ features that were unavailable, and claims that Apple cultivated ""a clear and reasonable consumer expectation that these transformative features would be available upon the iPhone's release,"" while also driving ""unprecedented excitement"" that convinced millions consumers to upgrade their devices when the upgrades were not necessary.

After confirming that the ‌Siri‌ features would be delayed until the coming year, Apple removed the ads, but that was after they had been running for several months. Apple is accused of advertising functionality that did not exist, and continuing to promote the ‌Siri‌ capabilities well after the company was aware that they would not be available on time.



Contrary to Defendant's claims of advanced AI capabilities, the Products offered a significantly limited or entirely absent version of Apple Intelligence, misleading consumers about its actual utility and performance. Worse yet, Defendant promoted its Products based on these overstated AI capabilities, leading consumers to believe they were purchasing a device with features that did not exist or were materially misrepresented.

Apple,"Ditch Your Apple Watch, The Galaxy Watch Ultra Is Now 50% Off on Samsung’s Store",Nothing to trade in? Samsung's also offering $230 of instant credit and phenomenal deals on accessories when you buy the brand-new Galaxy Watch Ultra.,https://gizmodo.com/ditch-your-apple-watch-the-galaxy-watch-ultra-is-now-50-off-on-samsungs-store-2000578493,2025-03-20T11:10:20Z,"When Samsung dropped the Galaxy Watch Ultra last July, it was instantly compared to the Apple Watch Ultra 2 which had come out several months earlier. In fact, we compared them directly, and basically ruled this clash of flagship smartwatches to be a draw in terms of quality and performance. But when Samsung decides to make the Galaxy Watch Ultra available for as little as $325 with trade-in credit or $420 without (down from $649), suddenly the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is looking very pricey indeed.

See at Samsung.com

If you’re able to max out the trade-in credit from Samsung and get the full $325 they’re offering, the Galaxy Watch Ultra comes in at less than half the price of the Apple Watch Ultra 2, basically making the choice for you. Even without a trade-in, the $230 in instant savings currently offered by Samsung makes the Galaxy Watch Ultra more affordable than the Apple Watch Ultra 2 by over $350. Either way, Samsung’s further sweetening the pot with great discounts on accessories, like 61% off a pair of Galaxy Buds3 or 41% off the Galaxy Buds3 Pro.

It Loves a Workout

Samsung has packed the Galaxy Watch Ultra with advanced fitness-tracking technology so it can go toe-to-toe with the vaunted Health app of the Apple Watch lineup. The Galaxy AI-powered heart-rate monitor eliminates inaccuracies caused by motion, providing exceptionally precise readings. The Galaxy Watch Ultra also delivers VO2 Max measurements, estimated sweat loss, and performance tracking for runners and cyclists, allowing you to compare previous workouts and gauge improvements over time.

This is the watch for you if you’re a hardcore adventurer and/or watersports enthusiast, because it can take anything dished out by your active lifestyle. The titanium case of the Galaxy Watch Ultra is ultra-durable, and engineered to keep up with your toughest workouts. With 10 atmospheres of water resistance, it’s ideal for swimmers, divers, and kayakers, while hikers and climbers will appreciate enhanced GPS tracking and turn-by-turn navigation that ensures you never lose your way.

The Numbers Don’t Lie

You won’t have to worry about the Galaxy Watch Ultra’s battery running out at inopportune times — it has the longest battery life of any Samsung smartwatch to date. That means after it tracks your toughest workout, you’ll be ready for bed and the Galaxy Watch Ultra will still be up and running to monitor your sleep quality.

Unless you have extreme brand loyalty to the Apple Watch or other fitness-oriented wearable, the option to buy Samsung’s newest flagship smartwatch for well under half the price of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 when you max out the $325 trade-in credit offer is hard to pass up on, especially when you consider they are basically neck-and-neck in terms of performance. Even with no trade in, the $420 price with instant credit makes the Galaxy Watch Ultra the clear choice.

Apple,Apple's AI promises are coming back to haunt it,"A California law firm is pursuing a class action lawsuit against Apple, claiming it falsely advertised Apple Intelligence.",https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-faces-ai-lawsuit-2025-3,2025-03-21T18:09:50Z,"This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

In its latest AI challenge, Apple is facing a false advertisement lawsuit citing delays in delivering its artificial intelligence features.

The complaint, filed Wednesday by Malibu-based Clarkson Law Firm in the US District Court in San Jose, accuses Apple of unfair competition, false advertising, and negligent misrepresentation.

""Consumers are excited about AI, and unfortunately that has led to Big Tech overpromising and underdelivering,"" Timothy Giordano, a partner at Clarkson Law Firm, said in a statement to Business Insider.

The plaintiffs in the class action suit, led by customer Peter Landsheft and other iPhone 16 owners, said Apple took ""advantage of consumers' desire for cutting-edge artificial intelligence software and features on their phones,"" and didn't deliver on all of the Apple Intelligence tools that were announced ahead of its iPhone 16 launch.

Since the September rollout, the iPhone 16 has been advertised as the first iPhone ""built for AI,"" and Apple Intelligence appears in a number of ads for the device. The tech is only available on iPhone 15 Pro models or later; the iPhone 16 lineup starts at $799.

But in a rare move, Apple announced earlier this month that Siri's planned AI upgrade, which was demonstrated months before the latest iPhone released, would take longer than expected. The plaintiffs referenced an ad from September featuring actor Bella Ramsey using a more personalized version of Siri.

Now, it's facing claims that it ""overstated AI capabilities, leading consumers to believe they were purchasing a device with features that did not exist or were materially misrepresented,"" the lawsuit says.

The tech giant introduced Apple Intelligence almost a year ago at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2024. Apple showcased an AI-powered iPhone with tools for writing and editing photos, among other genAI capabilities set to release that fall.

Apple Intelligence launched in October, one month after the iPhone 16 came out. The complaint says ""Apple's mirage of innovation"" included a personalized Siri assistant that can handle complex tasks and cross-reference iOS apps, a feature that Apple said will roll out in the ""coming year.""

Apple's play to catch up with AI rivals like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, and boost iPhone sales has also incited criticism of what it's delivered so far and questions about what's to come.

In 2024, ""Apple showed a demo, and it only does demos when things are nearly done, and it said it would ship 'later this year' and it never misses deadlines like that. So we should be using it, today,"" analyst Benedict Evans wrote in a blog post.

Internally, it seems that Apple is making changes to get things moving along in the AI department. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell would replace AI head John Giannandrea in overseeing Siri.

Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

The suit itself may not be enough to hurt Apple shares, but spotlighting its ""failure"" to deliver an AI-boosted Siri on time is a ""threat to Apple's market value,"" Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee told BI.

Apple has no place to hide now that competitors' genAI chatbots are up and running, he added."
Apple,Apple iPhone 16e review: Elevated basics,"The iPhone 16e is Apple's affordable phone for 2025. While it has considerable upgrades, it just costs too much at launch.",https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16e-review,2025-03-18T10:27:10Z,"The iPhone 16e has considerable upgrades over the outgoing iPhone SE 2022; you get a bigger 6.1-inch OLED panel, battery life that beats even the iPhone 16, terrific performance thanks to the A18, and all the Apple Intelligence features you could want. It also has USB-C connectivity and switches over to Face ID, and as a daily driver, it nails the basics. However, there's a single camera at the back, with the device missing out on a wide-angle lens. You don't get MagSafe or a 60Hz panel, and at $599, the device isn't as good a value as the iPhone 15. That said, if you need Apple Intelligence and stellar battery life, the iPhone 16e still makes sense.

Why you can trust Android Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

I liked using the iPhone SE 2022; while it was based on an older design, the refreshed internals and the diminutive design made it a fun device, and it was affordable. With the iPhone 16e, Apple is looking to update that formula; the phone has a bigger profile and includes Face ID as standard, and it gets USB-C connectivity. There's a bigger battery than the one in the iPhone 16, and as it is powered by the same A18 platform, it comes with all the Apple Intelligence features.



All of these upgrades come at a cost, with the iPhone 16e starting at $599. That puts it uncomfortably close to last year's iPhone 15, and while it does a great job with the fundamentals, it misses out on extras: you don't get a secondary camera at the back, there's no MagSafe, and the panel is still 60Hz.



But if you're on an older iPhone and looking to upgrade, there are enough new features on the iPhone 16e that make it a decent choice — if you don't mind the high asking price.

Apple iPhone 16e: Pricing and availability

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

Apple unveiled the iPhone 16e on February 19, 2025, and the device went on sale globally starting February 28. It starts at $599 in the U.S., £599 ($775) in the U.K. and €699 ($761) in other countries in the region, and ₹59,990 ($690) in India. The standard model comes with 128GB of storage, and you also get 256GB and 512GB variants. The iPhone 16e is available in white and black options, and this is what the device costs around the world:

iPhone 16e (128GB): $599 / £599 / €699 / ₹59,990

iPhone 16e (256GB): $699 / £699 / €829 / ₹69,990

iPhone 16e (512GB): $899 / £899 / €1,029 / ₹89,990

Apple iPhone 16e: Design

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

The iPhone 16e uses the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 as the foundation for the design, and the device has the exact same dimensions. It isn't quite as small as the iPhone SE 2022, and that's ultimately a good thing — that 4.7-inch size was getting too small anyway. The iPhone 16e has a good in-hand feel, and even though it has a bigger battery than the iPhone 13, it is a smidgen lighter, and that's always a good thing.

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

The positioning of the power and volume buttons is unchanged, and what I like is that the Action button from the iPhone 15 is available on the device. The button is just as customizable, and you can use it as a flashlight toggle, switching to silent mode, changing Focus modes, dictating notes, launching the camera, real-time translations, or a custom control.

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

I find the Action button to be the easiest way to toggle Focus modes, and I'm glad the feature is available on this device. Another iPhone 15 feature that trickled down to the device is the USB-C port; the iPhone 16e marks the end of the Lightning port, with all of the devices in Apple's portfolio now coming with USB-C. This is a positive move, and makes charging the 16e significantly easier.

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

The one feature that didn't make its way over is the notch; the iPhone 16e uses the older iPhone 13-style cutout and not the Dynamic Island that debuted on the iPhone 14 Pro and subsequent models. The older notch is distracting, and doesn't quite blend into the background as well as Dynamic Island. I find myself using the feature to easily control music playback on my iPhone 16 Pro Max, and not being able to do that here was irksome.

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

Another issue is with the choice of colors. The iPhone 16e is available in just white and black color options, and it misses out on the red variant that looked gorgeous on the SE 2022. Obviously, you can deck the device out in colorful cases, but as someone who doesn't use cases, I wanted a color option that stood out a bit more.

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

On that note, the build quality itself is terrific (as you'd imagine), with the phone getting an aluminum mid-frame sandwiched between two panes of glass. The back has a frosted glass finish that feels great, and as an added bonus, it doesn't pick up smudges.

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

The iPhone 16e has a single camera at the back, and the lens doesn't call out much attention to itself — in what is a stark contrast to the massive camera lenses that are a mainstay on all Android phones. The mid-frame has a matte texture that makes holding the phone just that bit easier.

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

There's a SIM card slot in global models of the device (just like the iPhone 16), but the U.S. version is limited to eSIM connectivity, but you can use two eSIMs at the same time. Another standard feature is IP68 ingress protection, with the device getting the ability to withstand submersion in up to six meters of water.



Although the design of the iPhone 16e is familiar, it has enough differentiated features from newer models that it stands out from the regular iPhone 13 and 14.

Apple iPhone 16e: Display

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

You get the same 6.1-inch OLED panel as the iPhone 13 and 14, and like those devices (and the iPhone 16), it is limited to 60Hz. It's annoying that 120Hz is still limited to the iPhone Pro models, particularly considering that budget Android phones also come with 120Hz as standard these days. It is a limitation on the iPhone 16e, and you can easily feel the difference when using it next to the iPhone 16 Pro Max or any Android device.

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

The panel is protected by Ceramic Shield, and it holds up to tumbles incredibly well. My 21-month-old daughter decided to throw the phone around the moment I unboxed it (she likes doing that), and it came away unscathed. You get True Tone and Dolby Vision alongside HDR10, and it has good brightness levels; while it isn't on par with the iPhone 16 or the Pixel 9, the 16e does a good job in this regard, and I didn't see any problems viewing the panel under harsh sunlight.

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

Colors are detailed, and contrast is excellent. In fact, the only other annoyance with the panel is that there's no always-on mode — that's again limited to the Pro models. The 6.1-inch size has been around a while now on iPhones, and going with this panel makes sense; although the notch is of an older style, it is immediately familiar.



Talking about the notch, it houses the requisite modules to enable Face ID, and it is just as fast and fluid as every other iPhone I've used when it comes to authentication. It also has the secondary speaker and camera, and they both do a good job.

Apple iPhone 16e: Performance

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

The key differentiator with the iPhone 16e is that it is powered by the same A18 platform as the regular iPhone 16 models. This gives the device a huge advantage, and although it is using a binned version of the chip that sees a quad-core GPU in lieu of the five that's standard on the other models, the rest of the features are identical. The phone also gets 8GB of RAM as standard, and again, this is higher than what's available with the iPhone 14 and 15.



The phone starts with 128GB of storage on the base model, and it can be configured with 256GB or 512GB. I'm using the 512GB edition, and it is just as fluid as the iPhone 16 in daily use. It handles demanding games with ease, delivering stable framerates without any lag. If anything, the 60Hz panel holds the device back, and it's clear that it is able to push higher framerates without taxing the internals too much.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Category Apple iPhone 16e Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max Xiaomi 15 Ultra Geekbench 6 (single-core) 2979 3344 2963 Geekbench 6 (multi-core) 6364 8131 8989 Geekbench AI (Quantized Score) 5426 6066 3587 3DMark Wild Life Extreme (score) 2729 3688 5834 3DMark Wild Life Extreme (FPS) 16.3 22.1 34.93 3DMark Solar Bay (score) 5175 6593 10006 3DMark Solar Bay (FPS) 19.7 25.1 38.05

There are no issues with overheating either, and overall, the phone does a fantastic job in this regard. The switch to USB-C means you can use a single cable to charge all of your devices, and while you don't get fast data transmission — it is limited to 480Mbit/sec — it is much better than using Lightning.



The iPhone 16e gets all the extras that are included on the iPhone 16, such as Emergency SOS, roadside assistance, and Find My via satellite, as well as crash detection. Interestingly, the iPhone 16e sees the debut of the C1, an in-house modem built by Apple that takes over from the Qualcomm-based solutions used in all other iPhones.

The modem doesn't have mmWave connectivity, but it has better efficiency figures, and this is evident while testing, with the iPhone 16e eking out better battery life than the iPhone 16. I didn't see any issues with connectivity or signal quality between the two devices, and it will be interesting to see if Apple is able to scale the tech to its entire iPhone portfolio.



Overall, the iPhone 16e is the fastest phone in its category, and if you're coming from an older device, you'll love what it can deliver.

Apple iPhone 16e: Battery life

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

The iPhone 16e has a sizeable 3,961mAh battery, and it lasts longer than any iPhone outside of the Pro Max models. Thanks to the bigger battery and efficient A18 platform, the phone manages to last over a day with relative ease, and even with heavy use, I got to the night with over 15% left.



There's no question that the iPhone 16e has an edge over the iPhone 16 and iPhone 15 when it comes to battery life, and if you need a 6.1-inch iPhone that lasts all day, this is the one to get. I also like that it charges over USB-C; this was a point of contention with the iPhone SE 2022, and I'm glad it isn't a problem with the 16e.



Like other iPhones, you don't get a charger in the box, and the charging is limited to 20W. The phone gets to the 50% mark in under 30 minutes, but it takes close to two hours to charge the battery using a standard USB PD charger, and unlike most Android phones, I left it plugged in overnight because of the lengthy charging times.



Another annoyance is that there isn't MagSafe, so if you've invested in the accessory ecosystem, you won't be able to use those with the iPhone 16e. That said, the phone goes up to 7.5W over the Qi standard, so if you have a charging mat, you can use it with the device — it just doesn't go up to 25W over MagSafe like the iPhone 16.

Apple iPhone 16e: Cameras

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

The iPhone 16e has the unwelcome distinction of being the only phone I tested in recent years to feature a single camera at the back. The phone has a 48MP camera with OIS, and while it uses in-sensor zoom to deliver the same caliber of shots at 2x, that's about as versatile as it gets.



The phone misses out on the new Photographic Styles that debuted with the iPhone 16, instead defaulting to the older system where you can pick between five choices. You still get a decent customizability in this regard, but it isn't quite what you get on the other iPhone 16 models. Similarly, there's no Cinematic mode or Action mode, but you get slow-motion video and the ability to shoot 4K60 footage.



The camera interface itself is identical to every other iPhone, with the shooting modes at the bottom, and the various toggles around the viewfinder. Thankfully, Audio Mix is intact, giving you much greater control while shooting videos, and there's Night mode when taking photos.

Image 1 of 6 (Image credit: Android Central) (Image credit: Android Central) (Image credit: Android Central) (Image credit: Android Central) (Image credit: Android Central) (Image credit: Android Central)

While it's not quite as good as the iPhone 16, the 16e manages to take good photos in any situation. Daylight shots have good detail rendition and colors, and the camera does a decent job in low-light, with the dedicated Night mode making a difference in this regard.



That said, the limited versatility is the biggest downside of the iPhone 16e; not having a wide-angle or telephoto lens is a big enough disadvantage that I'd suggest getting the iPhone 15 if you need auxiliary cameras. The 48MP camera does a good job at 2x as well, but go beyond that and you start to see visible noise.

Apple iPhone 16e: Software

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

The iPhone 16e comes with iOS 18.3 out of the box, and my unit got an update to 18.3.1 shortly after I set it up. As of writing, the iPhone 16e is the most affordable device with Apple Intelligence. Apple is pushing its AI suite as a differentiator, and while most of the features are still in beta, there's plenty of great potential. I'll be honest; I wouldn't have used anywhere as much AI features if Apple didn't showcase them at an event in Mumbai, India shortly after the debut of the iPhone 16e.

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

I'm ambivalent toward generative AI in general, but I'll admit that the iPhone 16e has one of the strongest AI-assisted feature-set of any device today. Visual Intelligence is Apple's answer to Google Lens, and it does a good job identifying locations, objects, and just about anything you look up. It is easy to use — it can be launched via the Action button, lock screen, or Control Center — and gives you decent information of the world around you.

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

In a similar vein, Writing Tools assist with proofreading and summarizing text, and you can use the built-in features to rewrite existing text. There's also the option to create unique images with text prompts via Image Playground, and custom emoji with Genmoji. You get the usual image-editing tools as well, and even if you don't use most of these features, it's clear that this is what Apple believes will make its products stand out.

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

Outside of the AI features, there isn't much new with iOS 18. The visuals have a slight refresh, but the UI as a whole should be immediately recognizable if you're coming from an older iPhone. There's a Control Center that houses all the usual toggles, and it is paginated now, giving you better access to customize media and any other controls. Focus mode is great to cut out distractions, and you get the usual privacy tools baked in.

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

The software is designed to be familiar while offering new tools. And as is the case with all iPhones, the iPhone 16e will pick up five iOS updates. Unlike most Android phones, there's no waiting to get the update (looking at you, Samsung); all iPhones can download the latest iOS version as soon as it is available.

Apple iPhone 16e: The alternatives

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

The iPhone 15 is the closest alternative to the 16e. It costs an additional $100, but you get a cleaner design with Dynamic Island, two cameras at the back, and MagSafe charging. However, the device doesn't last as long as the iPhone 16e, and you miss out on all the AI features.



Over on Android, the OnePlus 13R is my recommendation. It has a good design, vibrant AMOLED with 120Hz, two terrific cameras at the back, a massive battery with 80W charging, and a good overall value. Google's Pixel 9a should also be a good option to consider, and if it has cameras that are anywhere as good as the 8a, it should be a standout mid-range choice.

Apple iPhone 16e: Should you buy it?

(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)

You should buy this if:

You need Apple Intelligence

You want an iPhone with great battery life

You want terrific performance

You need Face ID and USB-C

You shouldn't buy this if:

You need a wide-angle or tele lens

You need an iPhone with a 120Hz panel

You want MagSafe connectivity

You want a good value

Ultimately, the iPhone 16e is a good phone, but a bad value right now. I can see this phone doing quite well if it sold at $449 or even $499, but at $599 it's hard to justify the asking price when you look at the omissions — the iPhone 15 becomes a better alternative instead. Yes, the iPhone 16e has a 48MP camera at the back, you get the A18 platform, better battery life, and it has all the AI-assisted features that you get in the iPhone 16.



However, there's just a single camera at the back, and that just isn't enough in 2025 — even entry-level phones have wide-angle lenses these days. Granted, these sensors tend to be average at best and unusable at times, but not including one at all on a $599 phone is a short-sighted move. Similarly, not including a 120Hz panel hobbles the device, and it makes it a poor bargain against Android rivals.



It's clear that the iPhone 16e is aimed at older iPhones users looking to switch to a (relatively) affordable model with the latest hardware. The inclusion of the A18 and all the AI features make it a decent choice in this regard, and if I'm looking at it purely as a successor to the iPhone SE 2022, it gets a lot right: you get a much bigger screen, significantly improved battery life, much better hardware, and a great camera at the back.



As an upgrade to the iPhone SE 2022, the iPhone 16e nails the brief. If that's what you're looking for in an iPhone upgrade, then the iPhone 16e is a good choice. Otherwise, the iPhone 15 gives you more value, even if you miss out on Apple Intelligence."

In a press release, Apple said that severance broke records as the most watched series on Apple TV+. Severance follows employees at a mysterious corporation who undergo a procedure that surgically divides their work memories from their personal ones, creating two separate consciousnesses. The story follows them as they begin to uncover the truths behind the company and the costs of these split identities.

Season 3 of Severance is available upon request.

Gurman briefly reiterated this possibility in his report this week about Apple executive Mike Rockwell becoming the new head of Siri development:

Rockwell's experience with hardware also could help the company more deeply embed AI into its future devices. Already, the company is exploring the idea of AirPods with outward-facing cameras that could feed data to AI.

The cameras would technically be infrared sensors.

In a June 2024 blog post, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple planned to mass produce new AirPods with infrared cameras by 2026. He said the infrared camera component would be similar to the iPhone's Face ID receiver.

Kuo said the new AirPods with infrared cameras would provide an enhanced spatial audio experience with Apple's Vision Pro headset.

""For example, when a user is watching a video with Vision Pro and wearing this new AirPods, if users turn their heads to look in a specific direction, the sound source in that direction can be emphasized to enhance the spatial audio/computing experience,"" wrote Kuo.

The infrared cameras could potentially enable ""in-air gesture control"" as well, allowing for device interaction with hand movements.

If the alleged 2026 mass production timeframe remains on schedule, the new AirPods with infrared cameras could launch in 2026 or 2027."
Apple,"'Severance' is a hit. Apple TV+ is not, even after six years.",'Severance' is the breakthrough hit Apple always wanted: Critics love it and people watch it. But Apple TV+ is reportedly losing $1 billion a year.,https://www.businessinsider.com/severance-hit-apple-tv-strategy-streaming-bet-2025-3,2025-03-20T18:31:32Z,"This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""Severance"" is the thing Apple always wanted but never had until this year: An HBO-style show that critics and chattering classes adore — and that regular people actually watch — streaming on its Apple TV+ service. The season finale debuts Thursday night.

That's the good news for Apple. The less-good news: Apple has been working on Apple TV+ for six years. And it's still unclear why, exactly, Apple has spent many billions on it.

That's the takeaway from The Information's new report on Apple's high-profile, very expensive service. Reporter Wayne Ma's story also has a couple data points we haven't seen reported anywhere else before: He reports, citing people with direct knowledge, that Apple is losing more than $1 billion a year on its streaming service, and that it has some 45 million subscribers — far behind leading services like Netflix and Disney Plus.

It's not shocking to see Apple losing money on its streamer. Netflix lost money for many years, and all of the would-be Netflix competitors lost lots of money in their first years. But Netflix now makes lots of money, and Wall Street has forced the big media companies that own other streamers to turn those operations profitable, or at least close to it.

But the issue isn't that Apple, which made close to $100 billion in profit last year, can't afford to fund Apple TV+ losses. It's that Apple still seems unclear about why Apple TV+ exists.

Ma says Apple executives have thrown out different ideas that all seem like a stretch — like that people who already own iPhones will be more inclined to keep them if they also watch Apple TV+, or that people who watch Apple TV+ on non-Apple devices might be inclined to buy one if they watch Apple TV+.

""However, the company didn't have internal data on whether that strategy ultimately led to higher device sales, according to multiple people who worked for Apple TV,"" Ma reports. Apple hasn't responded to my request for comment.

And, of course, there's the idea that Apple TV+ is just one of the services Apple uses to boost revenue when its core iPhone sales are slowing or actually declining. But that would make more sense if Apple TV+ was profitable or at least break-even.

Which is why people like yours truly, along with many other people who pay attention to media, have remained stumped about Apple's long-term plan here.

That includes Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos: ""I don't understand it beyond a marketing play, but they're really smart people. Maybe they see something we don't,"" he told Variety this week.

And there do seem to be limits to how much Apple is able to sink into Apple TV+ at this stage. That's why Tim Cook has been pressuring the service to watch its spending in general and on movies in particular — despite this weird insistence from Apple that its box office duds were actually profitable.

Who knows? Maybe this is the year Apple TV+ really takes off. Lots of people insist that The Studio, a Hollywood satire starring Seth Rogen that debuts next week is really good, and not just another Hollywood satire. The trailer for F1, a racing movie out this spring starring Brad Pitt, made by the director who made Top Gun: Maverick, looks pretty cool. But it would be weird if Apple continued to burn money on Apple TV+ for years to come without something tangible to show for it."

Apple,How can a tech giant 'build' a smartphone chip without its own foundry?,Fabless design isn't a new idea but companies like Apple and Google are making it an art form.,https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-can-a-tech-giant-build-a-smartphone-chip-without-its-own-foundry,2025-03-20T20:57:34Z,"The modern smartphone is a marvel of miniaturization, packing the power of a desktop computer into a device that fits in your hand. At the heart of this revolution lies the System on a Chip (SoC), a single integrated circuit that houses the CPU, GPU, modem, and a host of other specialized processors.

While companies like Apple and Google are known for ""building"" custom smartphone chips, they don't actually manufacture them. Samsung also designs chips and can build them, albeit in a different division of the company. Qualcomm has changed the industry forever by designing things nobody could ever build without them, and the company lets others build the actual products.

So, how do these tech giants design and bring these powerful components to life? The answer lies in a complex interplay of design expertise, intellectual property, and a specialized manufacturing ecosystem.

Turning an idea into a blueprint

(Image credit: Qualcomm)

The journey begins with the design phase, where teams of engineers, architects, and researchers conceptualize the chip's architecture. This involves defining the chip's functionalities, performance targets, and power efficiency goals.

For Apple, this means optimizing for iOS and its specific applications; for Google, it's about tailoring the chip to Android and its burgeoning AI capabilities. Samsung and Qualcomm need to build chips that anyone can use. It's not easy.

The core of the chip's design is its architecture. This dictates the arrangement of the various processing units and how they interact. Apple, for instance, invests heavily in its custom CPU and GPU designs, aiming for superior performance per watt. Google, with its Tensor chips, focuses on integrating specialized AI accelerators for on-device machine learning. Qualcomm strikes a balance between performance in all areas and connectivity options.

Each company knows what it needs better than anyone else does.

Once done on paper, engineers need to describe and build out the chip's logic. Hardware Description Languages (HDL) like Verilog or VHDL are used to ""program"" every behavior of the chip's circuits: every transistor, logic gate, and even the connections between them all.

Once someone is satisfied that this is going to work, the testing begins before anything is ever built. Software is used to simulate various behaviors, looking for bottlenecks in performance and potential errors and determining what other IP could be licensed to make a chip even better. Nothing is built in a vacuum, and no one company can do it all; the best products are a happy collaboration.

From there, the process is physically laid out by crazy smart people with backgrounds in electronics, physics, and manufacturing. Finally, parts can be built.

Apple or Qualcomm don't build their own chips. Neither does Google, and even the divisions at Samsung designing new products aren't usually the same ones creating them. For that, you need a semiconductor foundry. TSMC is one of the biggest, but there are others — including Samsung's own foundry.

The company that designed the chip works very closely with the foundry. There's a lot of back and forth to optimize the design for better performance and ease of manufacturing, and the final specifications are drawn out before the first chip rolls off the line.

The process of building a semiconductor is wild. Using complex masks and stencils, a chip is built layer by layer in rooms where not even a spec of dust is allowed. It's a total sci-fi vibe for a sci-fi product. The results are continually tested so the ""good"" chips make it to the customer who ordered them, then into your hands.

The fabless model has plenty of advantages

(Image credit: Source: Arizona State University)

It's easy to think of fabless semiconductor design as sort of like outsourcing, but it's a lot more than just a cost-saving initiative.

It allows a company like Apple or Qualcomm, who are well known for building excellent smartphone chips, to focus on the design and licensing of outside IP to build a product that meets consumer's exact needs.

Instead of trying to build and maintain advanced state-of-the-art facilities, they can partner with a company that has both the means and the experience to do it right. This makes adapting to an ever-changing market much easier.

Expertise in chip design, combined with strategic partnerships with leading manufacturers, allows them to create some of the most powerful and efficient smartphone chips on the market. This intricate ecosystem, where design expertise meets manufacturing prowess, is what drives the relentless innovation in the world of mobile technology."
Apple,"Wear OS will eventually gobble up the market share, but watchOS will keep most of the profit","Fifty watchmakers will sell more than one, but Apple will find a way to make a ton of cash.",https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-vs-watchos-will-mirror-android-vs-ios,2025-03-22T15:00:10Z,"In the beginning, there was Palm. Or Windows. Or Nokia. Or BlackBerry. Anyway, then came Apple.

The iPhone quickly became the industry standard for smartphones. Without offering any amazing new features, it captivated consumers in a way the existing offerings just couldn't. I spent far too much and chained myself to AT&T to get one, and there's a good chance you did, too.

This did not last. Someone at Google had the idea to try and make the smartphone more accessible to people who didn't want to or simply couldn't spend an arm and a leg with Android, and everything changed. Today, depending on the exact time of year, eight of every 10 new phones sold are powered by Android, but Apple makes more money than almost every other phone maker combined.

Android & Chill (Image credit: Future) One of the web's longest-running tech columns, Android & Chill is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.

We're about to see this happen all over again with wearables. In fact, it has already begun. Last year wasn't a great year for wearable sales (or any other goods, it seems), but it was a particularly bad year for Apple.

That doesn't mean Apple lost money, but it does mean the company saw its share of the market fall while competitor sales increased ever-so-slightly. Nor does it mean that Apple's watchOS and the Apple Watch aren't a smashing success because the company surely made more pure profit for each watch sold than any other company could dream of doing.

Again, this is exactly what happened with the smartphone. Very few people bought the first Android phones. Then Motorola and HTC made some headway (with the help of U.S. carriers), and the gap narrowed until places were switched. Somehow, Apple still makes more money, even today, thanks to a supernatural manipulation of the supply chain and the idea that Android phones are for ""poor"" people in North America.

This is how wearables are going to play out, too. The Apple Watch is yet another product Apple makes obscene amounts of profit per unit because it's good at business, and people in the U.S., Canada, and a few enclaves around the world will rush out to buy another one the minute it's available. Basic math tells you selling 100 things and making $10 for every one of them is more than selling 200 things and only making $2 from each.

None of that matters to me, and none of it should matter to you. I want to love a wearable but have a hard time doing it, and when I do wear one, it runs Garmin's goofy proprietary software, not Wear OS or watchOS. It's the one I like more than the others, and what you like is never going to matter to me. You need to do the very same thing and use whatever you like without caring what I think or which company makes more money.

It's also just the way both Apple and Google like it. One company wants numbers sold while the other wants profits per. Of course, Apple loved selling more watches than Samsung, but it loves the bottom line just as much.

This all weirdly makes sense. If you have 30 companies each selling a good product that people want, collectively, they will sell more than a single company that sells a similar, yet different, product. Wear OS, like Android, is a commodity like corn or crude oil that other companies use to create their own product. WatchOS is not and only available for the Apple Watch. A company trying to do it alone will never be the market leader when it comes to sales.

As long as Apple can capture customers in its reality distortion field and keep them buying expensive products and accessories to use with them, it will do just fine. Marketing is an incredible tool and Apple is the master at wielding it.

Apple,Google Missed a Huge Opportunity With the Pixel 9A,"Commentary: With Apple not refreshing its iPhone SE line, I feel Google had an opportunity that it squandered.",https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/google-missed-a-huge-opportunity-with-the-pixel-9a/,2025-03-19T15:00:00Z,"Google's Pixel 9A takes the essence of what makes the company's Pixel 9 Pro so good and wraps it up in a more affordable package. We've always loved the Pixel A series for their balance of performance and value, but I do feel this time round that Google missed a big opportunity and it all comes down to size. Apple recently launched the iPhone 16E and in so doing, essentially marked the end of its iPhone SE line -- a line that included the last truly small phone you could buy.

The 2022 iPhone SE had a 4.7-inch display which is tiny compared to the goliath proportions of the 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max. The iPhone 16E -- arguably the SE's spiritual successor -- measures 6.1 inches. I've written already that this marks the death of small phones, and I stand by that. For years I've maintained a roundup of the best small phones you can buy and it's become increasingly difficult to fill as all phones have ballooned well over 6 inches in size.

But many people do still want smaller handsets. Maybe it's because they have limited mobility in the fingers and using a huge display is more cumbersome. Maybe they love their skinny jeans and find a huge crotch-level bulge embarrassing. Maybe they just like using a smaller handset. I opted for the 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro, not the Pro Max and I still find its size a bit awkward to use at times. Whatever the reason, small phones have always had their place, but it's a segment of the market not being served by anyone anymore.

It's why I was disappointed to see that Google did not offer a smaller version of its Pixel 9A. At 6.3 inches the screen is a fair bit bigger than the 6.1-inch one on the Pixel 8A, and there's no way I'd have even called the 8A a small phone. When it comes down to actual dimensions, both the Pixel 9A and 8A are virtually identical and both likely a handful for someone wanting a tiny phone.

I trust that Google has done its market research here and as a result has decided that a larger phone is the better call for its business. But still, it would have been great to see the company experiment with a Pixel 9A Mini alongside the regular version, much like mobile companies used to do back in the day (both Apple and Samsung offered 'Mini' models for multiple generations, as did companies like LG, Sony, HTC and others).

A Pixel 9A Mini could have a 5.7-inch display which would offer a much neater overall package but still provide enough screen real estate to take advantage of all the AI functions Google is so obsessed with. It likely wouldn't need to compromise on the camera either, and while it probably wouldn't have space for the massive 5,100mAh battery of the Pixel 9A, the smaller display would require less power to run so your battery life would probably end up being on par anyway.

But Google didn't do this, and those of us wanting smaller handsets have to just continue readjusting our threshold for what's considered 'small'. Maybe if we all collectively cross our tiny fingers on both our diminutive hands, Apple will bring back a proper iPhone SE."
Apple,Apple Restricting New Pebble Smartwatches From 'Being Awesome' With iPhone,"Two new PebbleOS smartwatches were announced today by original Pebble watch creator Eric Migicovsky, revitalizing a Kickstarter-launched brand that had three years of mega popularity before it folded in 2016.





Called the Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2, th…",https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/pebble-smartwatch-apple-restrictions/,2025-03-18T17:19:24Z,"Two new PebbleOS smartwatches were announced today by original Pebble watch creator Eric Migicovsky, revitalizing a Kickstarter-launched brand that had three years of mega popularity before it folded in 2016.



Called the Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2, the two smartwatches run a PebbleOS, which is based on the source code for the software that ran on the original Pebble smartwatch. After Pebble shut down, assets were acquired by Fitbit, which was then acquired by Google. Google agreed to open source PebbleOS earlier this year, paving the way for the return of Pebble watches.

Like the original Pebble watches, the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 are platform agnostic and designed to work with iPhone and Android, but Migicovsky is already warning customers that Apple's restrictions are going to prevent the new devices from working like the Apple Watch.

Migicovsky says that it was difficult to design for iPhones when he was working on the original Pebble watch, and in the last eight years, ""things have actually gotten worse."" He said that his company will ""build a good app for iOS,"" but that it is impossible for a third-party smartwatch to replicate the functions of the Apple Watch. He shared an extensive list of the limitations:

There's no option for sending text messages or iMessages.

There's no option for replying to notifications or taking actions like marking something as done.

There is little inter-app communication, which makes it difficult for Pebble to work with other iOS apps.

If the iOS app is closed, the watch can't access the app or the internet.

The watch cannot detect if you're using your phone, so it will buzz and display a notification regardless.

There's no easy option to allow developers to create watch faces and apps for Pebble that would be available through the Pebble iOS app.

Migicovsky lamented that Pebble is required to go through the App Store, which is a ""gigantic pain"" because with every update, a ""random app reviewer"" could ""make up some BS excuse"" and deny updates. He says that Apple makes it ""nearly impossible for 3rd party wearable developers"" to create an experience that mirrors the Apple Watch experience.



Apple claims their restrictions on competitors are only about security, privacy, crafting a better experience etc etc. At least that's what they tell you as they tuck you into bed. I personally don't agree - they're clearly using their market power to lock consumers into their walled ecosystem.

According to Migicovsky, the new Pebble watches will have less developed functionality on iOS than Android, which ""is Apple's fault."" He said that he does not want to see complaints about the lack of functionality, so he is sharing the info now so customers can make an informed decision about whether to buy the product. ""If you're worried about this,"" he wrote, ""the easiest solution is to buy an Android phone.""

Migicovsky calls on ""Pebble-curious"" ‌iPhone‌ users to complain loudly to Apple or switch to Android, while also asking elected representatives in the U.S. to support legislation that would require Apple to make changes to its rules. In Europe, Migicovsky plans to petition Apple to request interoperability for Apple Watch APIs.

Migicovsky last clashed with Apple over the Beeper Mini app, and he has been outspoken about Apple's ‌App Store‌ rules since then, meeting with the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice. Beeper Mini reverse engineered iMessage protocols and encryption, using Apple's own iMessage servers to let Android users send ""blue bubble"" texts to ‌iPhone‌ users without the need for an Apple ID. Apple blocked the functionality, and Beeper was ultimately forced to give up on the idea.

The Core 2 Duo watch is priced starting at $149, and the Core Time 2 is priced starting at $225, with pre-orders available on the Repebble website. Both devices feature an always-on e-paper screen, physical buttons, step and sleep tracking, and a 30 day battery life, with the more expensive model also offering a heart rate monitor. The Core 2 Duo will ship starting in July, while the Core Time 2 will ship starting in December."

So when I saw that Google announced the Pixel 9a, I just read the headlines and just kept it moving. It wasn't until I read the excellent hands-on from Android Central's very own Michael Hicks that I started to look a bit deeper into what the 9a had to offer.

To get this out of the way, I don't like Google's decision to remove the camera bar. It's been a staple of the Pixel lineup since the Pixel 6, and while I haven't said this out loud, I was also disappointed when it was removed from the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Now, colors notwithstanding, the Pixel 9a just blends in with the sea of rectangles that everyone uses.

Anyways, on paper, the Pixel 9a is practically the perfect phone for the majority of people. Do you need an all-day battery life? The 9a delivers a 5,100mAh battery, paired with a larger vapor chamber for better cooling, which, in turn, should mean the Tensor G4 has a bit more room to breathe. Oh, and by the way, Google claims these two changes are the reasons why the camera bar was sliced off.

Speaking of performance, the Tensor G4 is in the cockpit, with 8GB of LPDDR5X riding shotgun. That sounds great, right? Actually, yeah, I think it sounds pretty darn good. What's that? You don't get Pixel Screenshots or Call Notes? Oh well.

Apparently, this is because Google is using an ""extra extra small"" Gemini Nano model. According to Ars Technica, Google confirmed that this model has other limitations, such as ""the lack of multimodality—Gemini Nano 1.0 XXS is text-only.""

Normally, I would put on my Jerry hat and be irritated that Google didn't figure out a way to include features that should be staples across the entire lineup. So why am I sitting here feeling the complete opposite?

Because this is the exact problem that Google needed to solve.

Flashback to last year's Pixel 8a release, and you would have a hard time convincing me that the Pixel 8 was actually the better phone. With the exception of the camera hardware and camera features, the Pixel 8a offered practically the same experience while costing $200 less.

With the Pixel 9a, there are quite a few differences, but Google managed to drop the less important features while providing some sound reasoning as to why.

(Image credit: Android Central)

The Pixel 9a still lets you enjoy the fruits of Gemini's labor, but it just might not be as fast and can't handle anything other than text. It's not equipped with the best camera that Google offers, but the 48MP main lens still sounds pretty darn good, and you aren't losing out on Google's image processing.

Sure, it has a larger screen and bigger battery than its brethren, but the camera bar is gone, and the bezels are massive. On top of that, the Pixel 9 features an ultrasonic fingerprint reader, but some would argue that an optical sensor is better anyway. Personally, I just think Google needs to embed it in the power button, but what do I know?

(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)

So, instead of getting 95% of what the more expensive version has, you get something closer to 85% or maybe 90%. All while paying $200 less and coming in a dollar short of the $500 imaginary line in the sand.

But what about the iPhone 16e? Yeah? What about it? Apple might have beaten both Google and Samsung to the punch with a new mid-range phone, but the iPhone 16e also costs $100 more and falls short in a lot of ways.

If you don't believe me, just check this out:

So, today Google launched the Pixel 9a, and it continues to show how much of an embarrassment the iPhone 16e is.Here’s everything the Pixel 9a has over the iPhone 16e, despite being $100 cheaper:– Blue and pink color choices– 6.3” display vs 6.1”– 120 Hz vs 60 Hz– 2,700… pic.twitter.com/Vj75GqF1JVMarch 19, 2025

Which reminds me, if you're feeling sour or betrayed by Google leaving out some Gemini features, just remember that Siri can't even tell you what month it is. No, I'm not kidding.

For years, if someone asked me to recommend the best phone for $500, I'd probably have told them to either wait for a deal or just get an iPhone. Even if that meant getting the last-gen iPhone SE, which still had the physical home button. That's no longer the case, as Apple continues to stumble and fall harder and harder while Google keeps mosying on along. As such, if you asked me that same question today, I'd tell you to quit talking to me and pre-order one already.

There's just something about the Pixel 9a that feels comfortable, and that's coming from someone who hasn't actually used one yet. Not only that, but the Pixel 9a might be the first Android phone that I would feel good about giving to an older family member. The peace of mind of being able to hand someone a phone and absolve yourself from being the dedicated tech support rep makes the Pixel 9a worth every penny and probably more."
Apple,"Force Apple to make its Watch less exclusive, and the entire smartwatch industry changes","If the DMA forces iOS to allow messaging on non-Apple Watches, it'd make fitness watches smarter — and let other smartwatches leave fitness behind.",https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/eu-dma-ruling-could-completely-reshape-fitness-smartwatch-industry,2025-03-23T15:00:00Z,"Sunday Runday (Image credit: Android Central) In this weekly column, Android Central Wearables Editor Michael Hicks talks about the world of wearables, apps, and fitness tech related to running and health, in his quest to get faster and more fit.

I'm not an expert on the EU Digital Markets Act, which, as of this week, requires Apple to make exclusive Apple Watch features available on third-party watches. Nor can I predict whether or not Apple will subvert or defy the ruling. But I can speak to how transformative this could be for fitness smartwatches — eventually — if Apple is forced to comply.

The DMA decision on March 19 lists out how Apple must provide ""effective interoperability"" to let any connected device ""receive, access, use, respond to, and transmit iOS notifications as well as to select and manage which notifications are displayed.""

Third-party watches would receive ""background execution"" access, so notifications and replies don't require the companion app running in the foreground as an intermediary. They'd also access faster data transfer (aka AirPlay) and settings like Do Not Disturb and priority notifications.

Apple will, of course, fight this tooth and nail. The Verge quotes an Apple spokesperson as saying, ""Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape...forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns.""

Just as Google failed to comply with the DMA, Apple may decide not to follow the ruling. But let's play out the hypothetical here and envision how fitness smartwatches (and non-fitness watches) could evolve with full iOS and Android access.

Garmin is the ""smartest"" fitness brand, and it can only do so much

(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)

Garmin represents the rare fitness brand that tries to sell ""smart"" mainstream watches like the Venu 3 or Fenix 8, with smart assistants, Garmin Pay, and a few third-party apps like Spotify and YouTube Music.

However, Garmin only pulled off a mini-walled garden of smarts and apps the same way Fitbit did before its Google acquisition. Both brands were so successful that they had the gravity to bring major apps to the bargaining table.

Be an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors

Garmin also used its higher cash flow to acquire businesses like Firstbeat Analytics and FitPay for a smarter training algorithm and contactless payments. Most fitness brands can't get third-party payment services to support them.

And because Garmin has an eclectic mix of iPhone and Android customers — its latest earnings show more than half of its sales come in Europe and Asia, where Android phones are more popular — it supports a couple of basic Android-only smart features, most notably quick replies to Google Messages and the ability to see images in notifications. Apple blocks both (for now).

But despite all that effort and its advantages, a Garmin watch isn't that advanced for messaging, turn-by-turn navigation, voice commands, and other tricks you get on watchOS or Wear OS. That applies double to brands like COROS, Polar, Suunto, and Whoop, which lack the same reach or leverage.

An open iOS means more non-fitness smartwatches

The new Pebble watches will be limited when connected to iOS (Image credit: Core Devices)

I'm excited to try the new Pebble watches, but former Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky had to ""set expectations"" on his blog about how Apple's policies hamstring them. Pebble watches on iOS can't offer to message, mark tasks as done, ignore notifications you've seen on your phone, support background execution, or create their own mini-app store for third-party watch faces and functions.

In his case, he says upfront that the definitive way to use a Pebble watch is to pair it with an Android phone. However, 40% of his interested customers use an iPhone; Apple's ecosystem is too large to simply ignore it.

Even most of the old Wear OS brands — Samsung Galaxy, Mobvoi TicWatch, and Fossil — were ""compatible"" with iPhones for years. But they had such limited functionality thanks to Apple's uncompetitive practices that they've mostly given up and turned to Google's semi-walled Wear OS garden to survive, or (in Fossil's case) given up on smartwatches.

They could only ""work"" on iOS because they had health and fitness tools independent of their blocked smarts. And every other non-Apple watch for iPhones has been funneled down this path.

(Image credit: Michael L Hicks / Android Central)

I believe that Apple's policies have (unintentionally) helped make smartwatches much stronger for health and fitness across the industry. After Pebble shut down, brands knew they couldn't make creative lifestyle watches without close phone integration for apps and messaging. So they focused on a use case that Apple couldn't restrict and turned a weakness into a strength with low-powered watches that lasted weeks.

If this ruling takes effect, it would change the entire industry. Yes, fitness watches would be unleashed to encroach on rival territory. And smaller, health-focused brands like Masimo and Withings suddenly gain access to greater smarts. But we could also see watches that emphasize something other than fitness now that they can.

The obvious example would be a Meta watch with the Meta AI assistant and EMG band for contextual commands and gesture recognition, unrestricted by Apple's policies. But I'd hope to see more indie brands like Repebble shoot their shot and try smart gimmicks that I've never even conceived of without the same pressure to add reliable health data or fitness coaching.

A distant and unlikely interoperable future

(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)

I don't know how much fitness smartwatches will change if Apple obeys this ruling. Yes, background refreshes, closer syncing with your DND settings, interactive replies, and quicker file transfers would benefit any fitness smartwatch. But not every smartwatch is optimized to use messaging.

They'll need mics for voice-to-text or AMOLED displays with faster touch sampling. This probably wouldn't be possible on watches like the Garmin Instinct 3, optimized for long battery life with a slower processor. Maybe Garmin would restrict messaging to its lifestyle watches and prioritize battery life on its Forerunners and Instincts.

Crucially, Garmin (and other brands) would be able to decide to stick to their strengths instead of Apple deciding for them. If they prioritized faster performance, this would benefit both iOS and Android users; a better chip and more widespread assistant would make RCS messaging better, too.

Of course, the original point still stands. This isn't like changing from Lightning to USB-C or allowing sideloading; it would fundamentally change the entire operating system, and Apple could spend years disputing the ruling. Then, fitness watches would have to license more robust hardware and test the software. Who knows how long that could take?

But if it does happen, it would certainly make things more exciting and competitive for smartwatch fans, whichever smartphone they own!"
Apple,Palmer Luckey's take on the 'ludicrously expensive' Vision Pro,"The Oculus founder discussed the ""ludicrously expensive"" Apple Vision Pro, which retails for $3,500, on a podcast.",https://www.businessinsider.com/palmer-luckey-discusses-apple-vision-pro-headset-vr-2025-3,2025-03-19T11:11:58Z,"Apple's Vision Pro is the technology of the future, according to Palmer Luckey and Tim Cook.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

It seems like Palmer Luckey gets where Tim Cook is trying to go with the Apple Vision Pro.

The Oculus founder and Anduril CEO shared his analysis of Apple's foray into mixed-reality headsets during an episode of the ""What's News"" podcast. Luckey said he's been ""consistent"" in his stance on the future of the pricey device since before it launched.

""I was telling people, 'Listen, you have to realize that what Apple's doing here is not trying to, with their first release, try to make something that is for everybody,'"" Luckey said.

Instead, he said, Apple is ""trying to set a very high standard"" with the $3,500 mixed reality headset.

The low demand for the Vision Pro since its release in February 2023 has reflected Luckey's assertion that the device doesn't seem to be catching on with non-tech enthusiasts.

""'They are trying to drag something out of the future that really shouldn't exist until 2026, 2027, and drag it into the present by making it ludicrously expensive,'"" the billionaire said.

His stance isn't far from Cook's own words about his product, which is pricier than competing headsets yet lacks a killer app to attract more customers. The Vision Pro isn't ""a mass-market product,"" but rather for ""people who want to have tomorrow's technology today,"" the Apple CEO told The Wall Street Journal in October 2024.

Luckey got his big break in VR when Meta, then Facebook, bought Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion in cash, and he maintained his optimism about the industry.

""You're going to see major players launching productivity applications, gaming applications, entertainment applications,"" Luckey said during the interview.

Representatives for Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider."
Apple,This watch has Pong and Missile Command instead of apps,Atari is now selling a smartwatch that prioritizes fun over functionality.

Atari is now selling a smartwatch that prioritizes fun over functionality. The watch’s user interface can be customized with Atari 2600-themed artwork and sound effects. But pushing it squarely into impulse purchase territory is the watch’s ability to play Centipede, Pong, Super Breakout, and Missile Command using the touchscreen or the watch’s crown dial functioning as a paddle controller.

Instead of trying to compete with the Apple Watch’s capabilities, the Atari 2600 My Play Watch targets longtime gamers nostalgic enough for the consoles of their youth to spend $79.99 on an elaborately themed fitness tracker. The watch is available for preorder now through Atari’s online store and is expected to ship by June 10th, 2025.

If the Atari 2600 My Play Watch feels familiar, it’s because it’s actually based on the Space Invaders My Play Watch that launched last September through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign. Its limited smartwatch capabilities are nearly identical to that previous version, including swappable watch faces and fitness tracking capabilities like step tracking, calories burned, and a heart rate monitor.

There’s still no Bluetooth or Wi-fi connectivity. So, while the Atari 2600 My Play Watch won’t pester you with notifications from your smartphone, you won’t be able to expand its capabilities by downloading apps or new games.

There are a few upgrades on the Atari 2600 My Play Watch. Its 2.02-inch touchscreen is slightly larger than the 1.86-inch screen on the Space Invaders watch, it has a beefier and more industrial-looking metal case, and there’s now a button located beneath its crown dial. It also comes with three swappable bands featuring retro graphic designs, although Atari says they will only be available for a limited time."

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.

Google has started rolling out new AI features to Gemini Live that let it “see” your screen or through your smartphone camera and answer questions about either in real-time, Google spokesperson Alex Joseph has confirmed in an email to The Verge. The features come nearly a year after Google first demonstrated the “Project Astra” work that powers them.

A Reddit user said the feature showed up on their Xiaomi phone, as spotted by 9to5Google. Today, the same user posted the video below demonstrating Gemini’s new screen-reading ability. It’s one of the two features Google said in early March would “start rolling out to Gemini Advanced Subscribers as part of the Google One AI Premium plan” later in the month.

The other Astra capability rolling out now is live video, which lets Gemini interpret the feed from your smartphone camera in real-time and answer questions about it. In the demonstration video below that Google published this month, a person uses the feature to ask Gemini for help deciding on a paint color to use for their freshly-glazed pottery.

Google’s rollout of these features is a fresh example of the company’s big AI assistant lead as Amazon is preparing the limited early access debut of its Alexa Plus upgrade and Apple has delayed its upgraded Siri. Both are supposed to have capabilities similar to the ones Astra is starting to enable now. Meanwhile, Samsung still has Bixby, but Gemini is nevertheless the default assistant on its phones."

Apple,Apple's Last M4 Mac: What's Rumored for the Mac Pro,"Across 2024 and the early months of 2025, Apple refreshed all of its Macs with next-generation M4 chips, with the exception of the M4 Pro. The M4 Pro is still waiting for an update, but it is supposed to get an overhaul later this year.





M-Series Chip

Th…",https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/mac-pro-2025-rumors/,2025-03-20T22:52:00Z,"Across 2024 and the early months of 2025, Apple refreshed all of its Macs with next-generation M4 chips, with the exception of the Mac Pro. The ‌Mac Pro‌ is still waiting for an update, but it is supposed to get an overhaul later this year.

M-Series Chip

The current version of the ‌Mac Pro‌ can be purchased with Apple's M2 Ultra chip, which came out in June 2023. It might seem logical for the ‌Mac Pro‌ to get the equivalent M4 chip, the M4 Ultra, but it turns out Apple might not have an M4 Ultra in the works.

When the Mac Studio was updated earlier this month, Apple announced a version with the M4 Max chip, and a version with an M3 Ultra chip, with no M4 Ultra unveiled. Apple told Mac Studio reviewers that not every generation of M-series chips will include a higher-end ""Ultra"" tier, so there may simply be no M4 Ultra that exists for the ‌Mac Pro‌.

There's now a question over what chip Apple will use in the ‌Mac Pro‌, and there are a few possibilities.

Apple does have an M4 Ultra chip coming, and it's not ready yet. There's some version of a high-end M4 chip that is not technically an ""Ultra"" chip and is instead called something else like ""M4 Extreme."" The ‌Mac Pro‌ will use the M3 Ultra chip. The ‌Mac Pro‌ will get an M5 Ultra chip.

The M1 Ultra, ‌M2‌ Ultra, and M3 Ultra chips that Apple has released have essentially been two Max chips linked together through an ""UltraFusion"" connector. The M4 Max does not have the UltraFusion connector available, so the first possibility seems unlikely.

Apple could be making an M4 Ultra or Extreme chip that is standalone and not a doubled up variant of the M4 Max, but Bloomberg's Mark Gurman recently claimed that Apple doesn't want to create an M4 Ultra chip from scratch because of costs, production challenges, and low sales of high-end and expensive machines.

Apple could refresh the ‌Mac Pro‌ with the same M3 Ultra chip that it put in the ‌Mac Studio‌, but if that's Apple's plan, it's likely the company would have just refreshed the ‌Mac Pro‌ alongside the ‌Mac Studio‌. The ‌Mac Pro‌ could be held back for other development reasons, but there aren't really rumors of notable new features coming.

We might be getting the first Macs with M5 chips later this year, but there's also a chance M5 Macs won't come until early 2026. Even if Macs with M5 chips do launch in late 2025, there's no guarantee that an Ultra version of the chip will be ready to go.

As of right now, there's no clear indication of what's in store for the 2025 ‌Mac Pro‌'s Apple silicon chip.



Design

There aren't rumors of design updates for the next ‌Mac Pro‌, so it's not likely that Apple has anything planned.



Ports

Apple added Thunderbolt 5 to the ‌Mac Studio‌ and MacBook Pro, so the ‌Mac Pro‌ will likely get Thunderbolt 5 ports too. Thunderbolt 5 will allow for more high-resolution displays to be connected to the ‌Mac Pro‌.



RAM and SSD

The M3 Ultra chip supports up to 512GB RAM, so if the ‌Mac Pro‌ gets the M3 Ultra or something similar, it will support a lot more RAM. The current model is limited to 192GB.

Storage maximums will also double, as the M3 Ultra supports up to a 16TB SSD, while the ‌Mac Pro‌ is limited to 8TB.



Launch Date

Bloomberg's ‌Mark Gurman‌ said last year that the ‌Mac Pro‌ will see a refresh toward the end of 2025, but given the chip uncertainty, Apple could be planning to hold it until 2026."

Apple,This hybrid smartwatch finally convinced me to ditch the Apple Watch,The ScanWatch Nova is a hybrid smartwatch that looks absolutely gorgeous. And it comes with all the health and activity monitoring you'd see in a regular smartwatch.,https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-nova-best-hybrid-smartwatch,2025-03-19T04:48:02Z,"I used dozens of Wear OS smartwatches over the years, but I ultimately settled on the Apple Watch because of its hassle-free usability and feature-set. My biggest annoyance with the Apple Watch is that it's unmistakably a tech product; it doesn't look or feel like an actual watch.

Hardwired (Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central) In Hardwired, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, audio products, storage servers, and networking gear.

This is where hybrid smartwatches come into the equation. These products look like regular watches, but they come with the usual smarts that you'd associate with a smartwatch, including health and activity tracking, workout logging, and even blood oxygen and ECG monitoring. So when Withings asked if I wanted to take a look at the ScanWatch Nova, I was interested.



I knew Withings made hybrid smartwatches, but I didn't pay particular attention to its products, so I had no idea what to expect with the ScanWatch Nova. I liked the design and thought it was an intriguing product, but it's only after I started using it that I understood its true potential.



Now, before we get started, you'll need to know that the ScanWatch Nova is pricier than most smartwatches in the market, and only the Apple Watch Ultra and Huawei Watch Ultimate demand a higher price. The hybrid smartwatch costs $599 on Amazon, and that's twice what you'd pay for a standard Galaxy Watch 7.

(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)

Thankfully, Withings justifies the cost by delivering what is the best-looking hybrid smartwatch around. The ScanWatch Nova has a gorgeous design, and the dive-inspired dial immediately allows it to stand out. I'm a huge fan of Citizen's products — I own a half-dozen Promaster watches — and the Nova looks like the Promaster Dive. It even gets a Super-LumiNova coating that allows the indices and hands to glow in the dark.

The Nova has a 42mm watch face, and it has a stainless steel case with polished edges, a ceramic rotating bezel, steel rotating crown, and anti-reflective strengthened glass. The watch has a metal bracelet out of the box, but Withings includes a fluoroelastomer band in the package, along with the requisite tools to adjust the links on the metal band, which is a nice touch.

On that note, the ScanWatch Nova is available in black, blue, and green dials, and I went with the green option as that looks particularly striking. The Nova still looks pristine after a month of use that included travel to three countries, and that's after my 21-month-old got a hold of the watch and decided to throw it about.

The design combined with the attention to detail makes the ScanWatch Nova one of the best-looking watches around, and the elegant design is a clear selling point. Coming in at 63g, the Nova isn't heavy that you'd notice, but it has the right amount of heft to feel like a regular watch — this is an issue with most smartwatches, which end up being too light.

At a quick glance, it isn't evident that the ScanWatch Nova is a hybrid smartwatch, and the only indicator to its smarts is the 0.63-inch dial that houses an OLED panel. It is a monochrome panel with a pixel density of 282PPI, and text looks clear without any fringing.



Text is easily readable even under sunlight, and while the size of the panel means you're limited in what notifications show up on the watch, it wasn't a big problem as such. It's easy to navigate the menus via the rotating crown, and you can view heart rate info and activity data with relative ease.

Although the ScanWatch Nova is a hybrid smartwatch, it has a full suite of health monitoring sensors. You get an optical module to measure heart rate, an SpO2 sensor, a new TempTech24/7 sensor that measures skin temperature throughout the day, and an electrocardiogram module that lets you take ECG readings on the watch itself.



In this regard, the Nova is just as good as a regular smartwatch, and if anything, Withings has an edge thanks to ECG readings. The feature does a good job, and even with regular heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, the Nova held its own against the best smartwatches.



There's also a cardio check-up that's bundled with the Withings+ subscription. I'm not a fan of subscriptions, and I don't quite see the point of Withings+; it has workouts and meal plans, and provides a scorecard based on your health and activity data, and while I used the trial, I didn't see enough value in paying $10 a month. Considering the cost of the Nova, Withings should have offered a free year of Withings+, but that isn't the case.

Coming to activity monitoring, the ScanWatch Nova does a good job logging steps, and it even has automatic activity detection. I tested it with my indoor bike, and while it took a little while to notice the activity, it logged it without any intervention. The data is in line with other smartwatches I tested, and while you don't get much metrics on the Nova itself, the mobile app does a great job highlighting activity data.



The only issue in this area is that the Nova doesn't include a built-in GPS, so if you're running outdoors, you'll need to bring your phone along. That is an annoyance, and other than this omission, there isn't anything missing on the smartwatch. I had no issues with notifications either, and while not as customizable as a regular smartwatch, it serves the need — and that's what I want.

(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)

The biggest advantage with a hybrid smartwatch is battery life, and the ScanWatch Nova excels in this area. I got close to three weeks of battery life before having to charge the smartwatch, and not having any battery anxiety is a genuine differentiator. The Nova uses a custom charging cradle, and it takes over two hours to charge, but you'll only be doing so once a month.



Ultimately, the ScanWatch Nova does everything I need in a smartwatch, but it doesn't look or feel like one, and the elegant design combined with extensive health and activity monitoring make it a great — if costly — choice. I used the watch for a month now, and in that time, I didn't feel the need to go back to the Apple Watch — which in itself is the highest praise I can give the Nova."
Apple,"Crowds are ditching the Apple Watch for Wear OS and other smartwatches, and there's a very good reason why",Smartwatch sales have seen a global decline for the first time and we look at what's contributing to this downward trend.,https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-gains-as-apple-watch-declines-2024-global-smartwatch-shipments,2025-03-20T19:56:20Z,"Smartwatches are gracing almost every other person's wrist these days—precisely 454.69 million people worldwide own one of these wearables that track everything from your steps to sleep quality and even your mental health.

That said, even while so many of us have this health tracker strapped onto our hands, in 2024, smartwatch sales fell by 7% for the first time, according to Counterpoint Research’s latest report.

This downward trend can mostly be attributed to the decline in Apple Watch sales throughout the year. Even though Apple is still at the top of the table, it saw the highest decline percentage in sales of 19%. Counterpoint Research claims that this could be due to several reasons, including people opting out of an upgrade due to a lack of new features or design. The research firm also says it could be because their first-time experience with the watch didn't go as planned.

On the flip side, Wear OS-powered watches and those running proprietary OSes scored some brownie points from customers as smartwatch sales saw a steady uptick this past year despite an overall slump across the globe.

Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei saw exponential growth, especially the former making its way to the top five this year. Xiaomi also became the fastest-growing brand, seeing a 135% rise in sales, thanks to the Watch S1 and Redmi Watch series. It began selling new Wear OS models, such as the Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro, in the 4th quarter of 2023, which likely contributed to this massive growth in 2024.

Huawei scored second, seeing a 35% increase in sales, although it notably does not sell Wear OS watches. Samsung placed third overall and also witnessed a 3% growth, thanks to the Galaxy Watch 7, Galaxy Watch Ultra, and Galaxy Watch FE Series, as seen in the infographic above.

Apple in trouble?

(Image credit: Apple)

Ten years ago, Apple released its first-ever Apple Watch Series, which was initially seen as a fashion accessory. That slowly took a turn to become the multi-faceted fitness tracker it is today.

According to data from Demandsage (a research firm), Apple rules 21% of the global smartwatch market, but the recent decline in sales for the first time points to evolving customer preferences, increased competition from other brands, and a slowing upgrade cycle.

""Apple’s steep decline was a result of the combination of Apple's infringement lawsuit against Masimo, increasing market competition, less significant upgrades in Watch Series 10, and the absence of Watch Ultra 3,"" Counterpoint's Senior Research Analyst Anshika Jain told Android Central in an email.

The absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases Senior Research Analyst Anshika Jain

(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)

Much like its iPhones today, Apple has stuck to the same Watch design for years. The first significant change showed up on the Apple Watch 4, which brought about larger screens and a more defined casing while maintaining the same rounded rectangular dial. Later the Series 7 brought with it thinner bezels, and even more larger screens. Cut to the Series 8, where Apple decided to give its watches a more rugged look and launched the Ultra (a sight for sore eyes).

Don't get me wrong, Apple has brought several advancements in tech, sensors, and processors over the years. But its overall ""look"" at first glance remained the same.

According to Gemini's AI Overviews, ""people generally upgrade their Apple Watches every 2-3 years."" Or when they notice significant performance issues or a life-altering feature, they'd want to ditch a year-old watch for a new one. For instance, I currently own an Apple Watch Series 8, which was a replacement and not a planned upgrade.

My Series 6 stopped working after water damage while swimming, which made it practically unusable. The Series 8 brought with it features that track women's health better, and for someone with a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, owning a watch that predicts ovulation cycles was a neat feature to have, and I continue to use it to date.

Jain also agrees that ""the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,"" especially in North America— which was the biggest driver of this decline in sales for Apple.

Wear OS shines through

Wear OS is the only real alternative if you want app support and rich notifications Nick Sutrich

While it would be unfair to pit Apple against the broader variety of Wear OS watches, due to the sheer number of manufacturers involved. However, as much as it isn't fair, Wear OS has become the undeniable alternative for many, sporting a ton of options, has seamlessly integrated into the Android ecosystem without people needing to change devices, and does almost everything that an Apple Watch could do.

Android Central's senior editor, Nick Sutrich, who uses a OnePlus Watch 3, highlights the same. Switching between the Pixel Watch 3 and the OnePlus Watch 3, Sutrich says that he has two main reasons why the Apple Watch just isn't for him. One, it's incompatibility with Android, and two, he hates the shape they come in.

""Wear OS is the only real alternative if you want app support and rich notifications,"" Sutrich said. ""I'd say I don't have a perfect choice at the moment. I prefer the Pixel Watch's size but like the OnePlus Watch 3's design and its battery life,"" Sutrich explained, demonstrating the flexibility that Wear OS watches bring, allowing users to pick between features that matter the most to them.

(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)

Beyond that, Wear OS, much like Android, is an open ecosystem that allows more freedom in terms of app availability and customization; for instance, Wear OS users can even create their own watch faces using the Watch Face Format available to those with a developer account. This freedom of personalizing your wearable without worrying about the phone's compatibility appeals to several people who choose to use a Samsung or a Pixel smartwatch over an Apple.

Furthermore, the affordability and hardware variety of Wear OS also drives people to reach for them. The recent decision of OEMs like OnePlus, Xiaomi, and OPPO to join the Wear OS family, which was mostly dominated by Samsung and Google, has not only resulted in a diverse range of watch designs and styles to pick from but has also made smartwatches much more accessible for those on a tight budget. This might've potentially impacted Apple's sales as well, according to Jain.

""Huawei’s comeback with Harmony OS, the rise of Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Honor, and the adoption of Samsung’s newly launched Galaxy Watch 7, Galaxy Watch Ultra, and Galaxy Watch FE series intensified competition for Apple in 2024,"" she added.

What does the future hold?

While the overall smartwatch sales did see a dip globally, this could also be attributed to several people wanting to move away from smartwatches for a much smaller fitness tracker like the smart ring. For instance, Android Central's EIC, Shruti Shekar, says she never really cared for watches; after using the Apple Watch 5—which negatively impacted her mental wellbeing, she decided to get an Oura Ring.

""I took on the ring and found myself loving it so much more than the watch,"" she explained. ""I found the passive health nature of the Oura Ring a lot more up my alley than a watch.""

That said, the future of Apple and Wear OS watches seems promising as both brands are working on bringing advanced health-tracking features. For instance, the Apple Watch Series 11 is rumored to have blood glucose tracking and satellite messaging features in the next Watch Ultra, which could turn the tide in their direction, according to Jain.

(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)

""Apple is expected to recover in 2025 with a low single-digit YoY shipment growth.""

""This is based on the expectations of the introduction of a satellite messaging feature in Apple’s Watch Ultra 3 in 2025 and the anticipated launch of the Watch SE 3 with an upgraded design.""

Jain also points out that with the rising adoption of Wear OS, we could expect advanced health monitoring features, improved battery life, and greater emphasis on personalization and customization.

For instance, the next Pixel Watch could see a ""rounded-edge bezel turned into a squeezable, touch-sensitive control interface,"" along with a smartwatch ""Fit Score"" that informs the user of the""differences in wrist size, skin color, hair density, BMI, fat percentage, and the likes.""

Integrating AI into their products could also push sales in the right direction. With more comprehensive health-tracking analysis combined with powerful hardware, like ""health sensors for measuring bodily signals such as serious heart health tracking, focusing on atrial fibrillation, sleep apnea, hypertension, and diabetes to sustain their position in the market,"" Jain explained."
Apple,"A20 Chip for iPhones Said to Remain 3nm, But With Key Upgrade for Apple Intelligence","While the iPhone 17 series is still around six months away, a rumor pertaining to next year's iPhone 18 series has already surfaced.

The original story follows.

While the iPhone 17 series is still around six months away, a rumor pertaining to next year's iPhone 18 series has already surfaced.



In a research note with investment firm GF Securities today, analyst Jeff Pu said the A20 chip for the iPhone 18 models will be manufactured with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process, known as N3P. That is the same process that is expected to be used for the A19 and A19 Pro chips coming in the iPhone 17 models, so the iPhone 18 models could have relatively small overall performance improvements compared to the previous generation.

Pu does expect the A20 chip to have one upgrade that he said will benefit Apple Intelligence capabilities. Specifically, he said the chip will use TSMC's so-called Chip on Wafer on Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology, which would allow for tighter integration of the chip's processor, unified memory, and Neural Engine.

If this information is accurate, the first iPhone chip to use TSMC's 2nm technology would be the A21 chip in 2027 at the earliest."

According to reports from CTV News and the Toronto Star this month, the features have yet to launch in Canada because regulations vary at the provincial level.



In the most populous Canadian province of Ontario, for example, hearing aids require a prescription from a physician or an audiologist.

The good news is that Apple recently told the Toronto Star that it is working with Canadian provinces to get approval to release the AirPods hearing aid and hearing test features over the counter. Apple told the newspaper that it hopes to make the features available as soon as possible, but it did not provide a timeframe.

With the clinical-grade hearing aid feature, AirPods Pro 2 can amplify the sound around you. The feature is intended for adults with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, according to Apple. There is no additional cost to use the feature.

Meanwhile, the five-minute hearing test allows adults to identify if they have hearing loss by measuring their ability to hear different frequencies of sound. Afterwards, the results will show a hearing loss classification and recommended next steps.

The two features first launched in the U.S. and select other countries in late October, and they continue to roll out to more countries.

There is a third AirPods hearing health feature — hearing protection — that is available in Canada.

All three features require AirPods Pro 2."
Apple,All Four iPhone 17 Models Again Rumored to Feature Apple-Designed Wi-Fi 7 Chip,"All four iPhone 17 models will feature an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain.

In a research note with investment firm GF Securities today, Pu said he believes that the Wi-Fi 7 chip's design was finalized in the first half of 2024. He expects the chip to debut in the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max later this year.

The entire iPhone 16 lineup already supports Wi-Fi 7, so the spec is not much of a surprise, but the fact that the chip will be designed by Apple is notable. Last month, Apple debuted its custom-designed C1 modem in the iPhone 16e, for cellular connectivity like 5G and LTE, and now the company is expected to make its own Wi-Fi chips too. By designing more of its own chips, Apple can reduce and eventually eliminate its reliance on external suppliers, including Qualcomm for modems and Broadcom for Wi-Fi chips.

Apple's plan to use its own Wi-Fi chip in iPhone 17 models this year was also mentioned by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

Wi-Fi 7 allows for data transmission over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously, with a supported router, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. Wi-Fi 7 can provide peak speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4× increase over Wi-Fi 6E, provided a device supports the maximum specifications.

All four iPhone 17 models should launch in around six months from now."

The Drop

Screen share

My favorite iOS browser these days is Quiche Browser. It’s somehow both incredibly simple and one of the most customizable browsers I’ve ever tried, which is a really hard balance to pull off. I spent 10 minutes mucking around in the settings, moving all the buttons and icons into exactly the right spot for me, and now everything seems to be where my thumb expects. It’s great.

Quiche is made by Greg de Jonckheere, a solo developer living in Japan. I reached out to Greg to see if he’d share his Quiche Browser setup with me, because I wondered if he had any cool tips I didn’t know about. Then I figured he should share with all of us and asked him to share his homescreen, too. Here it is, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:

The phone: Still an iPhone 15 Pro. That rumored iPhone 17 Air better be compelling and keep the USB-C port (a must for iOS app development), otherwise the old 15 Pro might have to go for another ride.

The wallpaper: I’m stuck with the iOS 18 default, not so much for its aesthetics, but because I love the idea of an animated wallpaper that transitions beautifully with the time of day. Now if only Apple could let developers create their own…

The apps: Quiche Browser (more on that below), Things (still the GOAT), Reeder Classic (same), Fantastical, Endel (in love with the new 8D Odyssey soundscape), Cosmos (like Pinterest, but with taste), Poolsuite FM (my favorite indie brand and radio), too many messaging apps (the perks of living in Asia while keeping in touch with friends and family in Europe — each country has its own go-to apps, and I need to be on all of them), plenty of Apple stock apps, and a folder full of apps to track my apps’ downloads, reviews, subscriber counts, and revenue, as well as one with development builds.

I use Spotlight and Siri suggestions a lot, as they’re surprisingly good at remembering the apps I use most depending on time and location. So, my home screen doesn’t necessarily reflect my actual usage.

I also asked Greg to share his Quiche Browser setup. Here it is:

A compact, one-row toolbar that fully disappears on scroll for full-screen, distraction-free reading

A left-handed-friendly button layout. From left to right: tab overview, new tab, search / edit URL, address bar, close tab

The address bar shows the page domain, title, and read time, but it doesn’t open the keyboard. Instead, it’s a large button that opens a menu with everything I need occasionally: history, downloads, settings, find on page, search this site, reader mode, move tab to private mode, copy URL, share, disable blocker, disable JavaScript, toggle dark mode, reload, undo close tab (phew)

No back/forward buttons. I use gestures instead

In night mode, the toolbar switches to full black with low-contrast buttons, and dark mode is enabled on all websites. Right now, I’m using a dark blue and orange custom theme, quite cozy for reading at night

And finally, I asked Greg to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he sent back:

“I just picked up a Supernote Nomad, which is hitting the sweet spot for an e-ink reader and notetaker for me. Being able to read EPUBs and PDFs while drawing on them like a physical book is exactly what I want out of an e-reader. Though it did start me down a rabbit hole of moving all my ebooks to Calibre, getting the metadata just right, and customizing the epub formatting with the right layout and custom font to make reading on my Nomad perfect.” — Sage

“Adolescence on Netflix. Amazing drama with hour long episodes filmed in one shot, single camera. Even includes a camera passover to a drone just to make things more complicated.” — Paul

“I’ve been using Ladder, and I’ve found it generally perfect. My coach drops six workouts each week and prioritizes three. On top of this, the iOS app is such a great experience. If you’re in the Apple ecosystem, it takes over your Apple Watch, integrates with Spotify / Apple Music, and tracks your vitals intra-workout, such as % of max heart rate. There are warm ups and cool downs, and I believe it’s as close to getting a personal trainer who creates a progressive training plan as is achievable in an app.” — Kevin

“URList, a little tool for making lists.” — Itay

“I finished rewatching FX’s Legion and was as glued to it as the first watch. What particularly caught my attention is some of the scenes narrated by Jon Hamm in Season 2 and how unfortunately prescient they are.” — Zayd

“I was absolutely fascinated by this 1970’s BBC documentary about how the coming age of the microchip would lead to ‘our children growing up without jobs to go to.’ Interesting echoes of the AI debate.” — Mike

“This week I am happily listening to Into the Aether, a low-key video game podcast. They are known for marathon GOTY-casts and console retrospectives. This week they announced they’re joining a podcast network, so I’m just really happy for them.” — Dan

“I’m going to Japan next week for my honeymoon, and have been using a couple tools to pick up basic Japanese. One of them is a game, Shashingo, which helps you learn through photography.” — Cameron

One of my favorite niche genres of YouTube is “I got a tour of a Disney lab.” There are tons of these videos out there — Cleo Abram and CrunchLabs both published some in the last two weeks, The Wall Street Journal and MKBHD did them last year, and there are so many more a quick search away — and I gladly watch them all. Even after watching the official Imagineering documentary, The Imagineering Story, I still can’t get enough of seeing the mix of practical, weird, useful, and just cool stuff happening inside the labs. It does feel like Disney’s cachet is not what it once was, but there’s still some amazing stuff happening inside the House of Mouse. Plus: everybody ends up doing some kind of lightsaber demo, and I am always here for a lightsaber demo.

See you next week!"
Apple,"The VR Hype Cycle Is Over, and Just in Time for the AR Hype Cycle to Begin","Say goodbye to the 'metaverse' as even a cheap Meta Quest hasn't turned things around. Instead, say hello to the return of 'glassholes.'",https://gizmodo.com/the-vr-hype-cycle-is-over-and-just-in-time-for-the-ar-hype-cycle-to-begin-2000578035,2025-03-19T21:10:21Z,"VR headsets are out, and AR glasses are in. Research from analysis firm Counterpoint shows that the global VR shipments trended down through 2024 despite proliferation cheap headsets like the Meta Quest 3s. Worse, VR sales numbers may not improve any time soon. The next step for these companies are glasses—with or without augmented reality capabilities. Big tech now needs to convince consumers thin glasses filled to the brim with AI are better than shoving a heavy piece of plastic on their noggins.

The number of VR headsets shipped globally fell by 12% year-over-year. Headset shipments fell a whole 5% in the last quarter of 2024. That was despite the grandaddy of the virtual reality hype bubble, Meta, promoting the $300 Meta Quest 3s. That cheap but capable headset gave the Mark Zuckerberg-led company an even greater VR market share than in previous quarters, consuming more slices of a dwindling pie. Sony managed to hold on to its bare 9% market share, likely because of its PlayStation VR2, which got a boost from its integration with PCVR late last year, plus the usual holiday discounts.

The luster is coming off the VR headset, and not just the really affordable ones. The Apple Vision Pro was similarly in decline in the last few months of 2024. Counterpoint said shipments of Apple’s first “spatial computer” fell by 43% in the quarter of 2024. The company had a small boost in sales when it took its headset to a few select global markets in the middle of last year, but it didn’t help its market share when it ended the year at just 2%.

The analysis firm contended that the VR market won’t gain much ground in the next two years. That’s mostly due to a lack of content and the common complaint about discomfort from shoving a screen in front of your eyes for hours on end. These complaints aren’t new. They’ve been present for years, even more so back when Meta was all in on promoting the shared VR world called “the metaverse.” Now that we’re several years past the hype cycle, Meta and Zuckerberg have glasses on the mind. The unexpected success of the Meta Ray-Ban has the company raring to go on more wearable products. The company also sees these glasses as a vehicle for getting you used to its cloud-based AI models meant to offer you a personal assistant straight from your face.

Counterpoint claimed the AR glasses market will grow 30% through 2026. The Ray-Ban Meta glasses proved such a big hit that Meta now hopes to release “half a dozen” new AR glasses models in 2025. Zuckerberg told investors earlier this year he thinks the company could sell “billions” of AI-enabled AR glasses to completely corner the market like it did with VR. Apple is further behind on its long-rumored smart spectacles project, though it may have something to show in the next few years, according to the latest rumors.

And still, more big tech players are getting into the VR/AR headset game. Samsung and Google are developing Project Moohan, an AR headset that seems close in capabilities and—if you look at its rumored specs—the high price to the $3,500 Vision Pro.

I’ve used the Ray-Ban Meta, and I wasn’t as impressed as others. They’re fine for shooting hands-free photos and video (though without control for focus or zoom makes them less than ideal). As for the much-touted AI connectivity, I have yet to find a use for a chatbot that routinely fails to identify objects around it correctly.

Beyond smart sunglasses, the next step for lighter, feature packed wearable devices is augmented reality visuals like a heads-up display scrolling in front of your eyes. CES 2025 was flooded with these kinds of devices, some of which with integrated AI chatbots and screens with blazing green text. I’ve put on plenty, and all of them still don’t feel like usable products. They lack a solid use case without capabilities that go beyond a typical smartphone.

Perhaps Google, Meta, Apple, or any number of smaller companies may show up in 2025 with something that is both light and powerful. The closest we’ve seen to that promise so far is Meta’s Orion, a pair of true AR glasses. And still, the issue with AR-capable wearables is that you need to stick a powerful computer in an incredibly small package. Meta’s pet AR spectacles project requires an additional data puck to function. It’s an issue that reportedly killed Apple’s plans for tethered AR glasses. We may be able to avoid the discomfort of headsets in 2025, but we may instead be tangled in a mess of wires running from our faces to our pockets or have AI chatbots talking to us through our glasses."
Apple,Apple Says EU Interoperability Regulations 'Bad for Our Products and Users',"The European Commission today published the decisions of its interoperability proceedings to assist Apple in complying with its obligations under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), but Apple has come out swinging, calling them ""bad for our products and bad f…",https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/19/apple-eu-interoperability-bad-for-products-users/,2025-03-19T14:49:18Z,"The European Commission today announced the decisions of its interoperability proceedings to assist Apple in complying with its obligations under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), but Apple has come out swinging, calling them ""bad for our products and bad for our European users.""



The DMA, which came into force last year, requires major platform holders or ""gatekeepers"" like Apple to provide third-party developers equal access to iOS and iPadOS system tools and features.

The Commission's first proceeding focused on iOS connectivity features for third-party connected devices like smartwatches, headphones, and virtual reality headsets. The decisions specify how Apple will provide effective interoperability for functionalities such as notifications, device pairing, and connectivity and data transfer functions like AirDrop and AirPlay.



The measures will grant device manufacturers and app developers improved access to iPhone features that interact with such devices (e.g. displaying notifications on smartwatches), faster data transfers (e.g. peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connections, and near-field communication) and easier device set-up (e.g. pairing).

The second proceeding focused on the process Apple has set up to address interoperability requests submitted by developers and third parties for iOS and iPadOS.



Developers will benefit from a fast and fair handling of their interoperability requests. The measures will accelerate their ability to offer a wider choice to European consumers of innovative services and hardware that interoperate with iPhones and iPads.

The final measures set out in the two specification decisions follow an extensive engagement with Apple and input by third parties as part of the public consultation launched in December 2024.

However, according to Apple, the DMA effectively requires it to hand over intellectual property to competitors, including companies whose business model relies on copying others. This intervention, argues the company, allows officials or third parties to influence iPhone development to the point of micromanagement, making it harder to introduce new technologies in Europe.

Apple also expressed its concern that some data-driven companies are exploiting the DMA to bypass EU data protection standards, and seeking unfettered access to user devices and data, including unencrypted access to user notifications and details on connected Wi-Fi networks — amongst other privacy and security risks Apple flagged in its December 2024 report, which specifically calls out Meta.

To comply with the DMA, Apple launched a portal for EU developers to request additional interoperability with iOS and iPadOS. With over 250,000 APIs, the company believes it already provides third-party developers with robust tools for interoperability while protecting user data.



""Today's decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple's ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don't have to play by the same rules,"" said Apple in a statement given to MacRumors. ""It's bad for our products and for our European users. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users.""

Apple said it has worked extensively with the Commission to comply with the DMA, and dedicated up to 500 engineers to the effort. The company believes it has met all requirements, and will continue engaging with regulators. But it's unconvinced the current demands will foster competition or innovation as intended.



Today's decisions mark the first time the Commission outlines concrete measures for a gatekeeper to comply with the Digital Markets Act,"" said Teresa Ribera, executive VP for clean, just and competitive transition. ""Companies operating in the EU, irrespective of their place of incorporation, must comply with EU rules, including the Digital Markets Act. With these decision, we are simply implementing the law, and providing regulatory certainty both to Apple and to developers. Effective interoperability for third-party connected devices is an important step towards opening Apple's ecosystem. This will lead to a better choice for consumers in the fast-growing market for innovative connected devices. Also, from now on, developers will enjoy more transparency as to how their interoperability requests are handled by Apple. Today moves us closer to ensuring a level playing field in Europe, thanks to the rule of law.

The DMA's specification decisions are legally binding and Apple is required to implement the specified measures. However, the Commission says the decisions ""fully respect Apple's rights of defense"" and remain subject to independent judicial scrutiny."
Apple,Pebble’s Successor Has Me Stoked for the Return of the Simple Smartwatch,"Even if it's just pretending, the novel simplicity of a watch with a few buttons and a small screen is a welcome respite from the complicated hell we live in.",https://gizmodo.com/pebbles-successor-has-me-stoked-for-the-return-of-the-simple-smartwatch-2000577589,2025-03-18T21:00:36Z,"The dream of the cool-but-not-overly-garish smartwatch is alive and well with not-Pebble’s new smartwatches, the Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2. Pebble, known by diehard nerds for making one of the gadget world’s most beloved throwback wearables, is reprising its vintage-looking smartwatches under a new moniker, Core Devices. Aesthetically, the smartwatches remain largely unchanged from the initial rollout in 2013, which is genuinely good news. After all, there’s no need to fix what isn’t broken. Smartwatches have become the all-you-can-eat buffet of the wearables world, often at the expense of battery life and user experience, not to mention the pressures of getting locked into an ecosystem.

The new duo of Pebble smartwatches don’t wholly escape the technological pressures of our modern times. For instance, a microphone enables you to interact with ChatGPT because there is no escape from our AI overlords in this current timeline. Step and sleep tracking are available in both watches, considered the bare minimum of “wellness” offerings in the wearable world, plus heart-rate monitoring in the slightly pricier Core Time 2. Both smartwatches claim a whopping 30 days of battery life, up from the original promise of seven days, which is more than even Android’s longest-lasting smartwatch, the OnePlus Watch 2R.

But everything else about the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 is simple. Of the two watches, the most “barebones” offering, the Core 2 Duo, is for the true minimalist. It doesn’t even have a touchscreen. You control it with four buttons, which is how regular watches are programmed. The Casio G-Shock, a classic favorite, offers the same tactile feedback button input exhibited by the Core 2 Duo. The only difference is that the software running on the smartwatch is easily hackable, whereas wristwatches are just clocks.

The colorful Core Time 2 is a little more sophisticated, but still, it appears approachable with its four-button input and 64-bit color display. This watch has a touchscreen for those with one foot in the present, making its $225 price tag a little easier to swallow. Compare this to the cheapest Apple Watch SE, which starts at $250, a little more than the Core Time 2. Yet it is a ticket into a vertically integrated ecosystem. It’s the same with an Android smartwatch from the likes of Samsung or Google. It is not only a gateway into Google but an invitation into an entire fitness ecosystem, whether it’s Fitbit on the Pixel Watch or Samsung Health on the Galaxy Watch. Even a basic fitness tracker from either brand feels like it’s straddling the line for those who want notifications on their wrist and a pedometer to track steps all day but don’t necessarily want to bother with a second or third account for logging in.

These new PebbleOS smartwatches are beginning a trend to move back to simplicity. It comes at a time when the /r/dumbphones subReddit has been particularly active. The Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 will not be manufactured en masse like a Samsung device. Core Devices only plans an initial production run of about 10,000 units. Although shipping doesn’t begin until July, you’ll want to pre-order yours before someone else takes your place.

As Pebble’s founder, Eric Migicovsky, who has helped revive PebbleOS, bluntly put it, the revamped Pebble watches aren’t here to compete with Apple and Garmin but rather to offer an alternative to those who need it. “If you’re looking for something that’s perfectly polished or looking for something like a Garmin, go and buy those watches.” As for the rest of us looking for a semblance of life before it was all shoved into a watch on a wrist, there’s deliverance coming."
Apple,"Amazon is Offering The Garmin Epix Gen 2 at Half the Black Friday Price, Now a Record Low","The updated Gen 2 Garmin Epix has built-in free expert training apps, incredible battery life, huge GPS range, and an awesome $409 price tag.",https://gizmodo.com/amazon-is-offering-the-garmin-epix-gen-2-at-half-the-black-friday-price-now-a-record-low-2000578919,2025-03-21T11:45:44Z,"If you’re serious about working out or an outdoor adrenaline junkie, there are lots of smartwatches that can be useful during your exertions. But Garmin’s smartwatches are specifically made for any and every physical activity or outdoor adventure. There’s a big difference, and it’s one you usually have to pay a premium price for. But Amazon’s just dropped a gigantic 54% sale on one of the very best fitness sportswatches around, the Garmin Epix Gen 2. This premium smartwatch is just $409 during this deal, a dramatic break from its usual $899.

See at Amazon

Compare and contrast: The Apple Watch Ultra 2 starts at $799, and even if you max out the big trade-in credit offers from Samsung, their Galaxy Watch Ultra would still be a little under $100 less than the Garmin Epix Gen 2. Those are stellar smartwatches that also offer many cool and useful fitness features, but the Garmin Epix Gen 2 is heads and shoulders ahead of them and the rest of the competition when it comes to hardcore workout and adventure capability.

Ready for Action

Before we delve into the great many features of the Garmin Epix, we should establish it as a legit tough and battle-ready smartwatch that’s able to withstand the elements and the occasional drop or collision. Start with the titanium bezel that looks premium and provides protection while not weighing down your arm. The body of the smartwatch is made from a fiber-reinforced polymer that acts as a lightweight yet nearly impenetrable suit of armor. The 1.3-inch always-on AMOLED screen is scratch-resistant, and the whole thing comes together to provide a unit that’s waterproof down to 10 atmospheres, in case your preferred form of adventuring happens on or in the high seas.

See at Amazon

When you take the Garmin Epix out into the wilderness, even if you’re headed off the grid, this smartwatch is absolutely packed with preloaded maps and exceptional satellite reception thanks to its multi-GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) support for not only GPS, but also Galileo and GLONASS to keep you safe. Elevation data, a barometric monitor, and 3-axis electronic compass complete the Garmin Epix’s outdoor package.

Take All the Gym Classes

There are 30 sports apps built into the Garmin Epix that track and gauge your performance, whether your fitness jam is trail running, yoga, HIIT training, or dozens of others. The Garmin Epix even delivers easy-to-follow animated workout moves for cardio, yoga, strength, and Pilates workouts, all easily seen on that big AMOLED screen that’s always on so you don’t have to stop to tap and refresh your view. The free Garmin Coach training plans are abundantly customizable to fit your goals.

Every health metric you need — heart rate, respiration, blood-oxygen saturation, stress levels, sleep quality and more — is captured and displayed for you by the Garmin Epix, along with Garmin’s exclusive Body Battery Energy Monitoring feature which takes all of those factors into account and lets you know when it’s time for a sensible rest day.

The Amazon-reduced $409 price tag on the Garmin Epix Gen 2 vastly undercuts the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and places it into a pricing competition with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, assuming you’re cashing in on one of Samsung’s frequent deals. But in terms of being suited for the most active adventurers and serious workout freaks, there’s no competition at all — the Garmin Epix Gen 2 is the smartwatch you need.

Apple,Severance‘s Creator Answers Our Burning Questions After the Season 2 Finale,io9 spoke with Severance writer and showrunner Dan Erickson about all things season two.,https://gizmodo.com/severance-season-2-finale-spoilers-interview-dan-erickson-2000578450,2025-03-21T15:45:15Z,"And now we wait. Season two of Severance just ended, leaving us with more answers than we expected but also new questions we never even fathomed. You can read our full breakdown here but, in addition, we were given a few minutes to talk to the show’s creator, Dan Erickson, with all spoilers on the table.

Clearly he wasn’t going to tell us what happens in season three or beyond—if it even happens—but we were able to ask him about the ending of the season, some of the bigger questions along the way, and even got a hint at what fans should be keying into as we wait for our favorite Macrodata Refiners to return to Lumon and Apple TV+

Germain Lussier, io9: Rescuing Gemma was clearly the big goal this season, but how did you approach telling that story while also setting up the end of this season with Mark choosing Helly?

Dan Erickson: It was all kind of baked in together, to be honest. I thought it would be an interesting challenge to start Mark off on that quest. And literally, you know, first thing you see this season is the doors open and he runs out and he is looking for Gemma. And he’s doing that not because he loves her, but because he knows his outie loves her. And in a way, I think he feels responsible. The development of his character over the course of the season was reaching a point where he values his own life and his own love and his own priorities on an equal level to that of his outie. He had come to feel that he himself was a human and was deserving of the things he wanted. And that’s why in that [finale] moment, you know, he’s staring at Gemma and I think it would be easier for him if he did feel love for her, but he doesn’t. And the person he loves is behind him, so that’s where he goes.

io9: The finale answers a lot of big questions—the goats, Cold Harbor, the numbers. How did you decide what you wanted to answer this season, what you could hold back, and was there any hesitation about actually giving us those answers this season?

Erickson: Sure. I mean, the good thing about the show is we always constructed it where there were sort of questions within questions. We have some sense now of kind of, like, what the numbers are on screen, what they’re doing, where is Mark’s wife, etc. But you can answer those questions in a direct way, but still not get to the “Why?” Sort of the big, scary, “What is going on on this show?” And so we really tried hard to structure it in a way where you’re clawing your way out of this box from the inside, and you don’t know what box you were in until you get out.

io9: Going off that, is there more to the question of why Mark and Gemma were chosen for Cold Harbor? Because we get some hints in “Chikhai Bardo,” but I’m just curious if that story’s over, or if there’s something there’s more to it.

Erickson: I think that’s something we’ll have to wait and see.

io9: Okay. “Woe’s Hollow,” to me, in a weird season is still the weirdest episode. I loved it. But is any of that stuff—where it is, who the doppelgangers are, the Kier family stuff—is that a crucial part of the story going forward, or is that just kind of fun, weird stuff that you like to play around with?

Erickson: I can’t really say [but] here’s what I will say. I think sometimes people ask in an almost accusatory way. It’s like, “Is there really any point to this?” Or, “You’re just being weird for the sake of being weird.” And you weren’t asking in that tone.

io9: Well, a little bit.

Erickson: My feeling is always like I, as a viewer, I love the Mad Max movies. And part of it is because of just the world-building. There are these whole systems and groups and cultures that we glimpse just barely, and all it does is build out the world. All it does is give us questions about, “Why does this world work the way that it does?” So there are some things on the show that are like that and that we intentionally will never explore because it’s fun to have questions. But I also completely understand people wanting answers, especially to the questions that we pointed at specifically, where we are like, “Hey, look at this.” To me, if we’re pointing at something and saying, “Look at this,” and then we don’t explain it, that one’s on us.

io9: Fair enough. With Woe’s Hollow as well as Salt’s Neck, season two started to show the world outside of Kier. Does showing more of the outside world factor into where you see the story going ahead?

Erickson: Yeah, I think so. I think that we had seen a little bit before. We had seen Ganz College in season one. But the show has kind of a weird relationship with the outside world. We’ve intentionally never gone to a real place. When you’re at Lumon, there’s this sense of being out of time and out of space and disoriented. That sort of extends to the outside world a little bit. It’s intentional that we don’t know exactly where we are. But we did want to build out this sense that there is a greater world at play here and that we’re part of something bigger.

io9: Yeah, they have iPhones, but they don’t have cars that are newer than 1980. Very interesting. Something else I kept keying into this season is Mark’s coughing. Is that a side effect of reintegration or is there more to it?

Erickson: [Pause] Hmm. You might get a different answer from somebody else.

io9: Okay.

Erickson: To me, that is a side effect of the reintegration. That’s sort of how I view it.

io9: All right. It’s clear here… well, not “clear,” but a little bit “clearer,” that this MDR was kind of focused on Cold Harbor, Mark, and Gemma. Are all MDR departments doing the same thing, or do you have plans to explain a little bit more about what MDR means in general?

Erickson: I can’t get into it too much. We do see that the others from other branches, they know how to do it. But I think there’s a question, even in our MDR with the four refiners, we’re not sure who the others are refining, if anyone. And I think that’s still a question.

io9: Without a doubt. Now I loved Mr. Milchick going back at Drummond in “The After Hours.” So much fun. But he seemed to forget about it the next day with all his dancing. Was that hint of defiance important to where you see the character going?

Erickson: Yeah, it is. I think Milchick is somebody who still cares about the job and cares about the work and believes in what they’re doing. And I think that he earnestly does want to bring a modicum of joy and humanity to the lives of the innies, which is kind of what he’s been trying to do the whole season to varying degrees of success. But he is also getting very tired of the people directly above him, and the way that they treat him and the way that they value him or fail to value him. Sometimes when we’re in a place that is systemically prejudiced or systemically toxic, sometimes we’re sort of trained to put our anger onto the people closest to us, as opposed to taking a step way back and saying, “Hey, is this whole system bad? Is this whole system hurting me and hurting other people?” So I think it’s a very human reaction that, you know, not undeservedly, but he directs that vitriol at Mr. Drummond as opposed to the greater company.

io9: Whatever the greater company might be. We still know about the board, a lot of things. All right, this is, unfortunately, my last question, and you probably can’t even answer it, but we’re getting a season three. What is the biggest question fans should be thinking about going into more Severance?

Erickson: I think that the question on Mark and Helly’s mind is going to be just “Now what?” I think they have chosen to continue to live, and I think they don’t know what that means exactly, how long they have, if this is something where they’re going to be able to exist for two more minutes or 10 more years? And so it’s the question of, what would you do to preserve your own existence? Now that you see yourself as an individual, you’ve started to get to know who you are, what would you do to defend that?

io9: I love that, and I have a billion more questions, but that is my time. Thank you so much for the show and for speaking with us today. I can’t wait to talk to you for season three.

Erickson: Thank you so much. I can’t wait either."
Apple,Latest iOS 18.4 Beta Lets You Turn Off Privacy-Compromising Search Feature,"iOS 18.4 includes a new Safari feature that puts your searches front and center, showing your recent search history whenever you open up a new Safari tab and tap into the search field.

When the feature first came out in the iOS 18.4 beta, there was no option to disable it, but Apple rectified that with the fourth beta update. In the Safari section of the Settings app, there is now a ""Show Recent Searches"" option that can be toggled off.

Disabling Show Recent Searches returns the Safari search interface to its iOS 18.3.2 behavior, where recent searches are not shown when tapping into the search window of a new tab.

Apple appears to have added the option to toggle off the search feature after receiving feedback during the iOS 18.4 beta testing period.

While some users may like the option to have recent searches readily available when opening up a new Safari tab, having searches so visible may not be desirable for those who sometimes need to hand over their iPhones and iPads to someone else.

iOS 18.4 is still being beta tested, with Apple aiming for an early April launch date. The update also includes new emoji characters, Apple Intelligence Priority Notifications, Visual Intelligence for the iPhone 15 Pro, a Vision Pro app, and more. All of the features in the update are listed in our iOS 18.4 beta guide."
Apple,Will Apple's Large-Screened Foldable be an iPad or a Mac?,"Along with a foldable iPhone, Apple is working on a larger foldable device that's somewhere around 19 inches, but rumors have been split on whether it's an iPad or a Mac.

Some reports refer to the device as an ‌iPad‌, while some call it a Mac, and the split seems to come down to the operating system on the device.

Is it a Mac?

Some rumors have suggested that Apple is developing a foldable MacBook with an all-display design. The MacBook already has a foldable design, of course, but the difference here would be a single display without an included keyboard and trackpad.



A foldable Mac would be able to be folded in half and used like a traditional MacBook with a virtual keyboard, or it could be unfolded and used as a display when paired with an external keyboard.

Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has referred to Apple's larger foldable device as a MacBook, and he thinks it's going to have an 18.8 to 20.2-inch display. Display analyst Ross Young has also written about Apple's work on a notebook with an 18.8-inch display.

The Wall Street Journal said in December that Apple is working on a 19-inch MacBook with a foldable screen.



Is it an iPad?

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has referred to Apple's large-screened foldable device as an ‌iPad‌, and he says it's going to have a display that's around 20 inches in size.



The Elec said in 2022 that Apple was developing a foldable device around 20 inches in size that folds down to 15.3 inches, and research firm Omdia believes that Apple is working on a 20.3-inch foldable OLED iPad that will be positioned as an iPad Pro.

While Kuo has also mainly referred to Apple's foldable as a MacBook, in 2023, he called it an ‌iPad‌ and said that it would come with a carbon fiber kickstand. Of course, Kuo initially said that such a foldable would come in 2024, something that did not happen.



Or both?

When thinking of a foldable with an all-display design, it's easier to picture an ‌iPad‌, which is already a single screen. It makes sense for Apple to create an ‌iPad‌ that's able to fold down for portability and then unfold into a larger workspace, but what if it runs macOS?

We don't have much of a reference for an all-display Mac since it's not a form factor we're familiar with, but a 20-inch device that's all display and folds in half would definitely be something of a hybrid ‌iPad‌ and Mac device.

Analyst Jeff Pu recently said that Apple's large-screened foldable will be a MacBook-iPad hybrid that's likely to run macOS, rather than iPadOS. Such a device would presumably have a touchscreen, and would require notable changes to the Mac operating system as it does not support touch input. Gurman also claimed that some of the design updates that Apple is making in iOS 19 and macOS 16 to unify the operating systems will pave the way for foldable devices and touchscreen Macs, so a hybrid is a possibility.

Whether the large-screened foldable is ultimately an ‌iPad‌ or a Mac will come down to the operating system that Apple is planning to use. If the device runs macOS, it'll be in the Mac family, and if it runs iPadOS, it'll be in the ‌iPad‌ family.



Launch Date

Rumors about the release date for Apple's foldable ‌iPad‌/Mac have targeted as early as 2026 to as late as 2028, so it's not quite clear when we'll see the device. It's possible that Apple is planning a launch for as soon as next year, and if that's the case, rumors should really start picking up in the next couple of months.

If we don't start hearing more soon, we can assume that Apple is aiming for a later launch date in 2027 or beyond."

Daring Fireball's John Gruber today highlighted a recent post from a Reddit user who asked Siri what month it is, only for Siri to respond that it does not understand. This is a frustrating experience that many iPhone users are all too familiar with, as evidenced by the dozens of replies to the post that provide similar examples of Siri being useless.

Apple recently delayed the more personalized version of Siri that it previewed at WWDC last year, with the reported reason being that the new features did not work reliably enough. But, the regular Siri that we already have is frustratingly bad, so perhaps Apple should focus on fixing that core before adding new features on top.

Something went wrong, Apple. Please try again."

As Apple TV Plus premiered the season 2 finale of Severance this Friday, Apple announced that the thrilling sci-fi series will return for a third season. And it seems like fans won’t have as long to wait as they did between seasons 1 and 2.

Apple CEO Tim Cook and Severance producer and director Ben Stiller also took to X with the announcement and a celebratory video. Stiller posted “So some fans are asking for Season 3 of Severance. What do you say, @tim_cook?” Cook post-quoted Stiller’s request, replying “Season 3 of Severance is available upon request,” with a video of notable shots of three from throughout Severance’s episodes.

“The idea of getting to make more ‘Severance’ with the greatest cast and crew on Earth is more thrilling to me than all the world’s finger traps combined,” show creator Dan Erickson said in Apple’s news release on the renewal. “I can’t wait to continue spreading woe, frolic, dread and malice with these truly incredible people.”

Severance’s first season premiered in February of 2022, and fans had to wait a long three years for season 2’s January 2025 kickoff. But there’s some indication that the folks behind the show are not looking to repeat that pace.

Stiller recently made an appearance on Jason and Travis Kelce’s podcast New Heights, and when asked if viewers would have to wait another three years for a new season, Stiller replied “definitely not. No, the plan is not, and hopefully, we’ll be announcing what the plan is very soon.”

Severance season 3 in late 2026, then, perhaps? Or early 2027? In the meantime, maybe you could become more of the you you are by reading some Severance-vibing books."

Apple,iOS 19 Coming in June With These New Features,"While the first iOS 19 beta is still more than two months away, there are already plenty of rumors about the upcoming software update.





Below, we recap the key iOS 19 rumors so far.



visionOS-Like Design

In January, the YouTube channel Front Page Tech …",https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/ios-19-rumors-list/,2025-03-20T21:04:07Z,"While the first iOS 19 beta is still more than two months away, there are already plenty of rumors about the upcoming software update.



Below, we recap the key iOS 19 rumors so far.



visionOS-Like Design

In January, the YouTube channel Front Page Tech revealed a redesigned Camera app that is allegedly planned for iOS 19.



According to Front Page Tech host Jon Prosser, the Camera app will have more translucent menus and buttons, along with a larger viewfinder. The alleged design looks similar to visionOS, the software platform for Apple's Vision Pro headset.

Earlier this month, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said the visionOS-like design changes will extend to other interfaces on iOS 19, meaning that the new look with more transparency will likely extend to additional Apple apps, notifications, and more.



Gurman believes that iOS 19 will have the most significant design changes since iOS 7.

Similar design changes are also expected for iPadOS 19 and macOS 16.



Personalized Siri

Apple recently delayed the more personalized version of Siri that it previewed at WWDC last year. The company said it anticipates rolling out the Siri upgrades at some point ""in the coming year,"" so the features could launch as part of iOS 19 later this year, but they are more likely to arrive next year in a later update, such as iOS 19.4.



Whenever they launch, the Siri upgrades will include understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. For example, during its WWDC 2024 keynote, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info from the Mail and Messages apps.



Live Translate With AirPods

At least some AirPods models will be getting a new live translation feature with iOS 19 and an accompanying firmware update, according to Gurman.



Here is how that feature will work, according to his report this month:

The capability will work like this: If an English speaker is hearing someone talk in Spanish, the iPhone will translate the speech and relay it to the user's AirPods in English. The English speaker's words, meanwhile, will be translated into Spanish and played back by the iPhone.

Google already offers a similar Live Translate feature.

He also said iOS 19 will have bolstered translation capabilities, which likely means improvements are coming to the Apple Translate app.



End-to-End Encryption for RCS

Earlier this month, Apple said that it plans to add support for end-to-end encrypted RCS messages to the Messages app in future iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS software updates. That likely means iOS 19, macOS 16, and so forth.



Apple promising end-to-end encryption for RCS messages indirectly confirms that it will be adopting the RCS Universal Profile 3.0 specification, which also includes several iMessage-like enhancements that were originally introduced in version 2.7 of the specification. iOS 18 supports RCS Universal Profile 2.4.

Here are five new capabilities to expect for RCS conversations on iOS 19:



End-to-end encryption, which will prevent Apple and any other third party from being able to read messages and attachments while they are being sent between devices

In-line replies

Edit messages

Unsend messages

Full-fledged Tapback support for RCS messages, ensuring they always work

iMessage conversations with blue bubbles have supported end-to-end encryption by default since iOS 5. In addition, iMessage has supported in-line replies since iOS 14, while the options to edit and unsend iMessages were introduced with iOS 16.

Apple has not indicated which iOS version will upgrade RCS, but iOS 19 or a follow-up update like iOS 19.1 or iOS 19.2 seems like a safe bet.



EU Changes

The European Commission this week announced a long list of changes that Apple is legally required to implement in future iOS 19 and iOS 20 updates.



The announcement clarifies interoperability requirements that Apple is required to adhere to in the EU, under the Digital Markets Act, which has been fully enforced since March 2024. The changes will further open up the iPhone and its technologies to competing companies and devices, and Apple is not happy about it.

We will be publishing an in-depth overview of all of the requirements, but in the meantime we have highlighted some key items below.



Third-party smartwatches must be able to display and interact with iOS notifications by the end of 2025, which likely means iOS 19.2 or earlier.

Apple must make its automatic audio switching feature available to third-party headphones by June 1, 2026, which likely means iOS 19.4 or earlier. This is the feature that allows most AirPods and select Beats to automatically switch connection between Apple devices, such as a Mac and an iPhone.

Apple must make changes to iOS that allow for third parties to offer equivalent AirDrop alternatives by June 1, 2026.

Apple must make changes to iOS that allow for third parties to offer equivalent AirPlay alternatives by iOS 20, or the end of 2026. iOS 20 is expected to be released to the general public in September 2026.

The entire list of changes can be found on the European Commission's website.



Compatible iPhones

According to French website iPhoneSoft.fr, iOS 19 will be compatible with any iPhone that is capable of running iOS 18, which would mean the following models:



iPhone 16e

iPhone 16

iPhone 16 Plus

iPhone 16 Pro

iPhone 16 Pro Max

iPhone 15

iPhone 15 Plus

iPhone 15 Pro

iPhone 15 Pro Max

iPhone XR

iPhone SE (2nd generation or later)

The oldest devices in that list are the iPhone XS, iPhone XS, and iPhone XR, all of which were released in September 2018.

Of course, some iOS 19 features will be unavailable on older iPhone models.



Timing

The first iOS 19 beta should be available immediately following the WWDC 2025 keynote in June, and the update should be released to the general public in September.

Apple,Apple is becoming a utility. That's hard for fanboys to take.,"Apple's utility-like evolution keeps iPhone sales steady, driving massive market value growth, even as AI delays leave fanboys disappointed.",https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-becoming-utility-iphone-fanboys-2025-3,2025-03-19T09:00:01Z,"A member of the NYPD Pipes and Drums using an iPhone to check bagpipe pitch ahead of a St. Patrick's Day parade.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

It's time to think differently about Apple.

The company is becoming a utility, which is hard for fanboys to accept, though it's not all bad.

The iPhone has become the standard tool for accessing online data and running our lives. Most owners don't care about cutting-edge AI or the latest speedy chip. They just need the device to keep working.

Apple fans have been aflutter lately over the company's decision to postpone new AI features, with some analysts predicting lower iPhone sales as a result.

That may be important for a tiny fraction of customers, such as Apple bloggers and the odd person who absolutely needs the latest and greatest iPhone. For everyone else, we don't care. We mostly want the battery to last all day, our apps to run, our texts to go through, and a camera to just work. This can be done with any iPhone, and it doesn't need AI.

Similar to an electric utility, we rely on the iPhone a lot. Most of us don't think about it passionately until something goes wrong. That's usually the battery degrading. Or when Apple updates the operating system, and a few older iPhones no longer work. Or you damage it beyond repair, or it gets stolen.

This drives an iPhone upgrade cycle that has become incredibly powerful and has little to do with fancy new AI features. Eventually, every one of the roughly 1.5 billion iPhones out there will have to be replaced.

""300 million iPhones have not upgraded in over four years,"" Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote recently in an email to Business Insider. ""That's a lot of pent-up demand.""

This is the main driver of iPhone sales now. It's not that sexy, and it's not high growth. Instead, it's big and steady, like a utility.

A chart showing iPhone unit sales. Dan Morgan, Synovus, and data compiled by Bloomberg. Red = estimate.

The chart above, based on data compiled by Dan Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus, indicates that iPhone sales have flatlined for a decade.

That might seem bad. But Apple shares have soared sevenfold in the past decade, massively outperforming the broader stock market. It's the most valuable public company in the world. By a lot.

During that same time, Siri — Apple's main AI offering — has sucked pretty hard. How much did that derail the iPhone upgrade train? Not much, judging by the data above.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment from BI.

Why Warren Buffett likes utilities and Apple

Warren Buffett, a massive utility investor, remains one of Apple's largest shareholders. In his latest letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, he listed Apple alongside other unsexy, non-AI companies, such as American Express, Coca-Cola, and Moody's.

He seems blissfully uninterested in the latest whizz-bang Apple technology and how that might help sell more iPhones in a given quarter.

""The idea that spending loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X or whatever are going to be sold in a given three-month period, to me, it totally misses the point,"" Buffett said in 2018.

Buffett likes Apple for similar reasons he loves utilities and other vaguely boring, profitable companies. Many people need what these companies sell, which helps them generate large, reliable returns — including juicy dividends.

'Panic' on the streets of Silicon Valley

A panicked human. Where's his iPhone? izusek/Getty Images

Electricity. Water. An iPhone. These are essential ingredients for modern life. Without them, things can get difficult quickly. Take my family's experience as an example.

My wife's iPhone was stolen last year. She waited only a few hours before driving to the nearest Apple store to hand over almost $1,000 for a replacement. She described the thought of existing without an iPhone as ""panic.""

First up: She used two-factor authentication via her iPhone to access sensitive work documents. She couldn't work without a new Apple device. (She's added a backup now. Guess what it is? An iPad!)

Then, a long list of other practical tasks revealed themselves to be difficult without an iPhone: booking an exercise class, texting a group of friends, keeping streaks going on mobile games, and accessing the iPhone's digital wallet for tickets she needed soon.

My daughter broke her iPhone beyond repair last year. She experienced similar panic and bought a replacement from Apple within 24 hours.

She uses a mobile app on her iPhone to authenticate and access her college accounts for submitting homework and doing other study-related stuff. She also had a plane to catch and was worried about not having the digital ticket.

Both my wife and my daughter worried about the data on their iPhones and thought it would be safer and easier to get a new iPhone to reclaim this digital information.

This year, my iPhone SE's battery started running low, and I struggled to hear people well on phone calls. These problems were fixable and probably related to user error. I could have gotten a new battery from Apple, for instance, yet I just could not be bothered. So I bought a new iPhone 16e. It was so easy, and my life was uninterrupted. I did not think about AI once during this process.

Android switching doesn't really happen anymore

My wife, my daughter, and I did not ever once consider getting an Android phone instead. For many nontechnical consumers, switching is too complex.

My wife knew her stolen iPhone was backed up in Apple's iCloud, so getting the same device again made the replacement process much quicker and smoother.

""I knew that if I bought another one, it would be as painless as possible to access my photos, wallet, apps, contacts, etc.,"" she told me. ""I was already pained by the stolen iPhone. Switching to Android at that moment made no sense. I'd have been breaking myself into jail.""

A 2023 study by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimated that only about 4% of Android phone buyers switched from an iPhone. The authors wrote that a big reason was ""fear of the complexity of switching.""

""There's not a lot of iOS-to-Android switching,"" said Josh Lowitz, a partner at CIRP. ""Switching between platforms is not that difficult, but the habits and iOS-specific apps and connections are hard to leave.""

This is why a year or so of delay in AI features won't matter much. When an iPhone stops working, its owner will almost certainly buy another, with or without AI.

So we should watch: How many old iPhones will Apple stop supporting? The company does an amazing job keeping these devices running for years. But after a certain point, the hardware just can't keep up.

That's when some handsets are dropped from iOS. Later this year, probably in September, Apple will do this again, and millions of people will have to pay to upgrade — just as I have to keep paying PG&E to pump electricity and natural gas into my house.

All is not lost

This is a long way from the cutting-edge technology that Apple fanboys love to nerd out about. There hasn't been much to get excited about lately on that front. Apple scrapped its car project. The Vision Pro mixed-reality goggles have flopped so far. And now, these AI delays show how far Apple lags behind Google, Meta, and OpenAI.

All is not lost, though. If Apple were a true utility, regulators would cap what it charges customers, which would probably crush the stock.

Instead, Apple can charge what it wants for iPhones. Take the latest example. The cheapest version of the new iPhone 16e costs $170 more than the last entry-level iPhone, the SE. That's 40% inflation in the base cost to access your digital life.

""Without a new iPhone SE, current iPhone SE owners will likely hold on to their phones a little longer,"" said CIRP's Lowitz. ""When they need to get a new phone, they will likely buy the most affordable new iPhone.""

What an incredible business. No wonder Apple has become the world's most valuable company — with or without AI."

Apple,The Bourne Franchise Is Up for Grabs,The Matt Damon-led spy thriller series based on the Robert Ludlum books could find a new home away from Universal.,https://gizmodo.com/the-bourne-franchise-is-up-for-grabs-2000578884,2025-03-21T00:00:25Z,"Universal Pictures has owned the rights to the Jason Bourne action spy franchise for decades, but that could soon change. Matt Damon has starred in four of the five existing films featuring the character created by author Robert Ludlum, going back to 2002’s The Bourne Identity.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, WME and the estate of the late Ludlum have begun shopping around the IP for a potential reboot of the franchise at a new home. According to the trade, the interested parties include Skydance, Apple, and Netflix. With the chaotic state of movie theaters and streamer tentpole duds, studios are definitely scrambling to get their hands on tried and trusted IP, as was just seen with Amazon taking creative control of the James Bond series.

Universal could retain the Bourne rights if it chooses to outbid potential buyers in competition for the franchise. Under Universal, the franchise also includes sequels The Bourne Ultimatum (2004), The Bourne Supremacy (2007), The Bourne Legacy (2012, with Jeremy Renner stepping to star), and Damon reprising his role in 2016’s Jason Bourne. As THR notes, “it is too early to say if [Damon] would be involved in the new iteration.”

The series has also attracted talent behind the camera, with Andor creator Tony Gilroy writing or co-writing all entries except Jason Bourne, and directing The Bourne Legacy. Other series directors have included Doug Liman and Paul Greengrass.

There’s also a staged stunt show inspired by the series at Universal Studios Florida called The Bourne Stuntacular. With the studio seeing a huge success in genre with Wicked, it will be interesting to see if it sticks with the spy-fi content it has mined from Bourne over the years."

Based on rumors, a second-generation AirTag item tracker is likely next up.



Last year, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that a new AirTag would be released around the middle of 2025. More recently, a leaker known as Kosutami claimed that Apple plans to release a new AirTag in May or June this year. Both of those timeframes suggest that the next AirTag is a few months away from launching.

Three upgrades have been rumored for the AirTag 2:



With a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, the AirTag 2 is expected to have up to 3× longer range compared to the current AirTag. The chip debuted in the iPhone 15 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2. On the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models, there is a Precision Finding for People feature that can help you to find your friends in crowded places, and it offers a range of up to 200 feet/60 meters.

The new AirTag's built-in speaker is expected to be more difficult to remove or tamper with, as an anti-stalking safety measure.

The new AirTag is rumored to have improved integration with the Apple Vision Pro.

No major design changes are expected.

The original AirTag was announced during an Apple Event in April 2021. In the U.S., an individual AirTag costs $29, and a set of four costs $99."

Google Wallet is rolling out tap-to-pay for kids on Android, letting them make in-store purchases with their phones.

The feature is launching in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Spain, and Poland over the next few weeks.

Kids need approval from their parents to add a card, and parents can track spending or remove the card anytime.

Children can now install the Google Wallet app on their Android phones and start using tap-to-pay to make purchases in stores.

After first revealing the feature back in October, Google now says it's rolling it out in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Spain, and Poland in the next few weeks.

Google Wallet’s tap-to-pay system, similar to Apple's solution, lets users store payment information on their phones or smartwatches for easy use. Previously, kids under 13 couldn’t set up payment profiles, but that rule is changing, opening up the feature to younger users.

Kids can now use Google Wallet’s tap-to-pay feature to make contactless payments, unlocking it with a fingerprint, face scan, PIN, or passcode. The app lets them store things like gift cards and event tickets.

(Image credit: Google)

Parental controls keep things in check

To help parents manage their kids’ spending, there are a few built-in limits. First, kids can’t add a card to their wallet without a parent’s approval. Once a card is added, parents can monitor transactions and remove the card if needed. Plus, the cards can only be used for tap-to-pay in stores, meaning no online shopping is allowed.

The feature initially launched on the Fitbit Ace LTE. After it got a thumbs-up from users of the kid-friendly smartwatch, Google decided to bring it to Android devices managed through Family Link.

Google's move puts it in closer competition with Apple, which has long let kids use Apple Pay in stores through Apple Cash Family. But there's a big difference—Apple also allows online shopping and peer-to-peer payments, while Google Wallet sticks to in-store tap-to-pay only.

Apple,Foldable iPhone to Feature Impressive Battery Life Despite Thinness,"Apple is putting a heavy focus on improving power efficiency while slimming down key components in its upcoming foldable iPhone, with battery capacity now a key priority for the company, according to a new report citing sources within Apple's supply chain.


…",https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/foldable-iphone-impressive-battery-life-thinness/,2025-03-21T10:11:30Z,"Apple is putting a heavy focus on improving power efficiency while slimming down key components in its upcoming foldable iPhone, with battery capacity now a key priority for the company, according to a new report citing sources within Apple's supply chain.



According to Korean news aggregator account ""yeux1122"" on the Naver blog, which has previously offered accurate insights into Apple's component strategy, Apple is specifically refining the display driver IC (DDI) used in its first foldable iPhone, with the goal of achieving a thinner overall design.

The DDI is a key component that converts digital signals from the device's processor into the analog signals needed to control the display's pixels. Improvements to the DDI can enable thinner panel assemblies, lower heat output, and reduced power consumption – all of which are critical in compact devices like foldables with multiple displays.

Multiple sources now agree on key specifications for Apple's first foldable iPhone, including a 7.8-inch main display when unfolded and a 5.5-inch cover display. The consensus comes from analysts Ming-Chi Kuo and Jeff Pu, as well as the Weibo leaker Digital Chat Station. The agreement on the details suggest Apple may have finalized significant aspects of the device's hardware.

According to Kuo, the foldable iPhone will adopt a book-style design, opening horizontally like a Galaxy Z Fold, rather than the vertical clamshell form factor of Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip.

Jeff Pu reports that the device has recently entered the New Product Introduction (NPI) phase at Foxconn, a key stage in Apple's production timeline. Both Pu and Kuo anticipate mass production beginning in the fourth quarter of 2026, which opens the possibility of a limited launch as early as next year.

In terms of hardware, Kuo claims the foldable iPhone will feature two rear cameras, a single front-facing camera, and a Touch ID sensor integrated into the power button –suggesting Apple may skip Face ID for this model, likely to save internal space. It's expected to include a high-density battery and a titanium chassis, with the hinge constructed from a combination of titanium and stainless steel.

As for dimensions, Kuo believes the device will measure just 4.5mm thick when unfolded, and between 9mm and 9.5mm when closed, making it notably thin compared to current foldables.

Apple's efforts to optimize hardware efficiency across its product lines are already in motion, with the iPhone 16e featuring its first custom-made C1 modem. Apple said the C1 modem is the most power-efficient iPhone modem ever, and it has held up fine in both real-world and simulated 5G speed test results.

Apple is on a mission to make the thinnest possible devices in each product category, beginning with the most recent iPad Pro and continuing later this year with the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, which is expected to be the second device to use the C1 modem."

If you want to draw, sketch, or take notes on your iPad, the Rock Paper Pencil kit is a must have. It's the best way to match the feel of writing on paper, and it makes using an ‌iPad‌ as a writing surface much more pleasant.



Rock Paper Pencil is an all-in-one kit that includes a textured screen protector and a special tip that connects to the ‌Apple Pencil‌. This combination turns the glossy, unnatural feel of writing on an ‌iPad‌ into a natural, paper-like experience. Not only does it feel like writing on paper, it sounds like writing on paper, plus you get more control over stroke output because of the friction from the added texture.



Astropad's screen protector uses NanoCling technology to adhere to the ‌iPad‌ with static cling, and you can put it on and take it off as needed with zero residue on the ‌iPad‌'s display. With the NanoCling technology, the screen protector fits right up against the display of the ‌iPad‌, providing a flat surface with no ridges or gaps.



Rock Paper Pencil's tip fits on the ‌Apple Pencil‌ Pro and other ‌Apple Pencil‌ models, and it is able to hold up to heavy daily use.

Episode 10 of season 2 will have the longest runtime of any episode so far, coming in at 76 minutes.



Tonight's season finale will wrap up the season 2 storyline and provide some insight into just what the Macrodata Refinement department does and what ""Cold Harbor"" really is. A brief teaser for episode that Apple shared on social media highlighted one of the goats, so we might also learn what Lumon's Mammalians Nurturable team does with them.

Severance has become one of Apple's most talked about shows, and it has spawned countless fan theories, with viewers speculating about what's going on after every episode.

In an interview yesterday, Ben Stiller said that work is underway on Severance season 3, and this time around, we won't have to wait three years for more episodes."
Apple,We’ll Never Be Okay After Severance’s Epic Season 2 Finale,"'Cold Harbor' brings an end to Severance's second season with big twists, big answers, and even bigger questions.",https://gizmodo.com/severance-season-2-finale-recap-cold-harbor-2000577739,2025-03-21T14:00:38Z,"The season two finale of Severance was more than just an episode of television. It was an epic mini-movie that felt bigger and more impactful than everything we’ve seen this entire season combined. After episode upon episode of teases and questions, the episode, appropriately called “Cold Harbor,” finally sat us down and said, “Here’s what this means, here’s what that means, and how do you like it?” We got answers to big questions, endings to major stories, and, of course, so many additional mysteries we barely know where to start. But start we must. Full spoilers below.

Things start where last week’s episode left off, with innie Mark confused about his whereabouts and staring down his old boss, Harmony Cobel. She jumps right into the Gemma stuff and when she mentions the exports hall, Mark brings up Irving’s drawings. This throws Harmony—Irving was drawing the exports hall? How did he know about it?—but that quickly gets glossed over for more pressing things. Even so, we imagine that could be an important piece of info later on, especially since Irving’s story is at a crossroads.

After another brief scene with Helly and Jame back at MDR, where Jame confesses he doesn’t love his daughter Helena but sees Kier in her innie (a very startled Helly), things really get cooking. Cobel and Devon explain to innie Mark their plan to hopefully extract Gemma from Lumon. The thought is that if they break her out, it proves Lumon kidnapped her, faked her death, and it would be the end of the company. Which is a great plan for Devon and Cobel but not necessarily Mark’s innie. He sees that as sacrificing his life for someone he doesn’t know but before he can think too much more about it, they tell him someone else wants to chime in.

It’s outie Mark, who has recorded a message for innie Mark. This is something we’ve wanted from basically day one, for both versions of Mark to talk to and understand each other. And while things start relatively innocent and even heartfelt, things slowly take a turn. Innie Mark questions how this plan benefits him and the other innies. Outie Mark tells him about reintegration and that they can be one, to which the innie asks for an explanation. Mark doesn’t have one. Eventually, outie Mark brings up his innie’s relationship with Helly, but he mistakenly calls her “Heleny”—and that’s the moment Mark’s innie flips on his outie and begins to defy and challenge him. We realize that while these are two different versions of Mark, it’s still just Mark. Each one wants what he wants and is unwilling to compromise for it. What a Severance viewer is left to wonder is, is one more right than the other? And which do we side with?

The conversation has gone to shit so Cobel steps in and gives us maybe the most direct and clear exposition dump in Severance history. She explains that the numbers he deals with at work each day represent the mind and tempers of Gemma. And, for each file Mark has completed, he’s allowed Lumon to create a new innie for her. Once the 25th and final one, Cold Harbor, is done, the project will be complete and they’ll have no more need for Mark, Gemma, or the rest of the MDR employees. She says it’s over for them. Innie Mark isn’t sure if he can believe her so he storms out and tells Devon to tell his outie that the next thing he sees better be the severed floor or else he’s not going to help.

Which is, of course, where things immediately go. But before continuing on with the rest of the episode, I almost want to rise up in front of my Apple TV+ app and give Adam Scott a standing ovation for those scenes. The way you can clearly see differentiations between both his outie and innie, and also how they each go on a full journey from excited, appreciated wonder, to pure venom and confusion, was remarkable. A tour de force if ever there was one.

Back at Lumon, it’s the day all the creeps have been waiting for. Mark S. is going to finish Cold Harbor and, to mark Mark’s achievement, he and Helly are greeted with a brand new painting outside the elevator (“The Exalted Victory of Cold Harbor,” it’s called. It’s amazing and I need it) as well as an eerie wax statue of Kier in the middle of MDR. The statue holds a note from Mr. Milchick letting Mark know that Kier wanted to watch the work and that when he finishes, “goodly splendors” will await. And, as you probably already know, those “goodly splendors” did not disappoint.

The start of the day also held another surprise, the return of Dylan. When last we left him, Dylan’s innie had quit Lumon but, it turns out, his outie didn’t agree to it. We, as well as Mr. Milchick, assume the worst of this but in a truly touching moment, innie Dylan is handed a letter from his outie that doesn’t go how anyone expected. The outie basically thanks his innie for being so badass and explains that he’s not particularly confident, so his innie’s existence gives him hope for himself. Outie Dylan writes that if he wants to quit, he can, but that he hopes he doesn’t because he’s so happy to know he’s out there. Seriously, the execution and performances in this scene were both so good, I cried. And that Mr. Milchick was so busy he had to literally sprint out of the room was just the hilarious cherry on top.

Mark is ready to start working on Cold Harbor, but he’s not sure if he should. Helly tells him about Jame Eagan showing up, and Mark tells her everything he learned from Cobel. Basically, if he finishes the file, there’s a good chance they’ll cease to exist. Helly knows that her outie would be fine with that so she pushes Mark to take the leap and rescue Gemma. Whether Cobel is lying or not, Helly says at least there’s a chance Mark can continue on. Mark says he doesn’t want to continue without her and the episode once again hints at what will ultimately be its biggest question. Is it humanly possible for both parts of Mark to share happiness?

Work on Cold Harbor begins, with both Dr. Mauer and Mr. Drummond watching on from the testing floor. As he works on it Mark and Helly talk about places they know of, places they don’t, and joke about what they think “the Equator” is. Episode director Ben Stiller shoots all of this in extreme close-ups that give the conversation an added element of emotion and intimacy. It’s all a nice distraction because, eventually, Mark lands on the last few numbers. They hold hands, get close, and finish the file.

After two long sections filled with tension and emotion, the finale needed a release valve. And a release we got, first from a stirring lights-and-music fueled introduction (akin to the Chicago Bulls in the Michael Jordan days), second from some awkward comedic banter between Mr. Milchick and the animatronic Kier statue (during which both have their feelings hurt and Kier hints Cold Harbor is just the beginning of a larger plan). Finally, we hear Milchick call for the Choreography and Merriment department. Yes, the severed floor at Lumon has an entire department dedicated to dancing and music in the form of a full-on marching band. The reveal, coupled with Mr. Milchick finally getting to do some of the dancing that made him so memorable in season one, is quite possibly the most awkward, absurd, and flat-out hilarious moment in Severance history. A total 180 from everything else we’ve seen up until here.

And yet, it’s wasting time. Mark knows he is on a ticking clock to get to the testing floor before Gemma is killed. “See you at the equator,” he and Helly romantically say, before she steals Milchick’s walkie-talkie, creating the diversion Mark needs to make a run for it. Helly manages to trap Milchick in the MDR bathroom and is able to keep him there until Dylan appears and shoves the vending machine in front of the door for support.

After following the sheet of directions through Lumon’s maze of hallways that Irving left behind, Mark finally finds the entrance to the exports hall. He’s unaware of what’s happening in the secret room adjacent to it, where Mr. Drummond has summoned Lorne from the Mammalians Nurturable department (Gwendoline Christie, making her return), along with a goat. This particular goat, Drummond is assured, has “verve” and “wiles.” It’s here we finally find out what the goats on Severance are for. They’re bred to be sacrificed and put into coffins with dead bodies to guide their spirits to Kier’s door. This particular goat is being killed for a “cherished woman” who is never named—but from everything we know, we can safely assume he means Gemma.

Drummond produces a bolt gun and instructs Lorne to kill the goat, but they’re interrupted by a sound outside the door. It’s Mark trying to get into the exports hall. A massive fight ensues between Drummond and Mark, though it’s not really a contest; Mark’s about to be strangled to death with Lorne emerges and saves him. Drummond then fights Lorne, except this time he’s met his match. Mark takes Drummond hostage and Lorne thanks him for saving Emile (the goat’s name is Emile).

Severance isn’t known for action for violence so seeing a scene like this, with the stakes as high as they are for all involved, was dramatically brash but perfectly warranted. An unexpected, yet welcome, change of pace. One that took an almost Coen brothers twist when, in the elevator down to the testing floor, Mark’s outtie reemerges and mistakenly fires the bolt gun into Drummond’s throat, killing him as blood shoots everywhere. RIP Mr. Drummond, you piece of crap.

While much of the above was happening, we saw Gemma put on her outfit for the day—she immediately realizes it’s her own clothing, from the night she left her home with Mark and never returned—and get led to the one room she’d never visited before: Cold Harbor. Inside, the ominous voice of Dr. Mauer tells Gemma to take apart a baby crib, which she does without a word or otherwise reacting in any way. The implication here is that Cold Harbor allows Lumon to make severed individuals without emotion. Without thought. Complete and utter blank slates that will do anything if merely asked. The possibilities of it are staggering and while it’s certainly not the answer most people may have thought of to “What the hell is happening here on Severance?” it’s at least an answer. Mauer and, most importantly, Jame Eagan watch on with frothy delight.

That is, of course, until they realize that plan is about to go to shit. Outie Mark arrives on the testing floor and, after a brief encounter with the nurse, is able to enter Cold Harbor using Mr. Drummond’s blood. Gemma is still taking apart the crib when he enters and as he calmly asks her to leave, the success of Cold Harbor is what aids him. Gemma ignores the cries of Dr. Mauer and she cautiously, but obediently leaves with Mark. Mauer and Jame scream in horror because they know this is very, very bad. Once Gemma leaves the Cold Harbor room, she snaps back to herself and it’s the reunion we’ve been waiting for. Mark and Gemma, the wife he thought to be dead, together once more. But will he be able to break her out?

Upstairs, the Choreography and Merriment department has been playing this entire time (which really added to the overall tension anytime things cut back to loud, boisterous band music). They’re about to leave at Milchick’s request when Helly gets up and makes her Emmy-moment speech. She talks about how this floor is going to close and that everyone has already lost friends. She pleads that severed people are only given half a life and Lumon thinks they won’t fight for it. The speech works and by the time Milchick exits the bathroom, the entire marching band has turned to stare him down. “Fuck you, Mr. Milchick” Dylan defiantly says.

“You’ll kill them all,” Dr. Mauer ominously screams as Gemma and Mark make it to the elevator. There, as expected, they snap back to their innies, Ms. Casey and Mark S. Mark was prepared for that though and they make a break for it. There isn’t much in the way of opposition since it seems everyone from Lumon is either trapped or dead, so they quickly reach the exit stairs. Ms. Casey opens the door and flips back to Gemma, who starts screaming for Mark, the husband she’s finally been reunited with, to follow her. Only, it’s not her Mark. It’s innie Mark. And here’s when that incredible opening to this episode comes back.

Innie Mark has completed his mission for outie Mark. They worked together to get Gemma out. But, we know, he also wants to exist. To be complete. And so, with his outie’s wife on one side and his innie’s love, Helly, on the other, Mark makes his choice. He decides to leave Gemma behind and be with Helly. This is their equator.

As “The Windmills of Your Mind” by Noel Harrison plays, the two make a run for it, certainly aware, but not caring, that they can’t leave this place. They only exist in this place. And if they stay there, changes can’t be made to fix it. But they don’t care, they’re in love. And no one knows what’s next. The season closes on a freeze frame of the two of them running scared, with their luscious locks billowing in the air.

Season two of Severance starts with Mark running to find Gemma and it ends with him and Helly running to stay together because it’s all they can do. After an edge-of-your-seat 76 minutes of tension, it’s an ending that’s probably not quite as maddening as season one’s but is even more tantalizing. Then, you had a clear idea of what had to happen. Here, we have no idea. Mark’s decision to stay with Helly asks so many impossible questions with even more devastating implications. Then there’s the potential fallout from Gemma’s escape and it means for the future of Lumon. But, hopefully, we won’t have to wait three years for answers to any of it.

As we come to the end of the season, I wanted to thank each and every one who sat down and read these each week. Recapping a show this epic is not an easy task and I hope my blood, sweat, and tears helped bring you some enjoyment and or insight. Let’s do it again in season three."
Apple,Matthew Belloni on the ‘Apple TV+ Experiment’,,https://puck.news/how-long-can-the-apple-tv-plus-experiment-sputter-on/?sharer=167184&token=1ff8c319cdac678ace91127c99abfc96,2025-03-21T18:01:48Z,"All of which fed into the self-centered fears of my lunch date. What, if anything, does the current state of Apple mean for its entertainment business? After all, more than five years into the Apple TV+ experiment, it’s never been entirely clear what C.E.O. Tim Cook and services chief Eddy Cue are up to in Hollywood. Certainly not making money, at least not in the traditional sense. The Information reported today that Apple lost $1 billion on Apple TV+ last year, following a Bloomberg report that more than $20 billion has been shoveled into making original shows and movies since 2019. That’s not nothing, even for a company worth $3 trillion.

The “loss” number is a bit misleading, of course, considering Apple has always said that a key goal is to leverage Leo DiCaprio and Reese Witherspoon to thicken its brand halo and the device “ecosystem,” ultimately boosting its other businesses. But still… for all its billions, Apple TV+ has accumulated only about 45 million subscribers worldwide, according to today’s Information report and other estimates.

That’s far less than Disney+, Max, and Paramount+, all of which launched around the same time. Those rival services are attached to legacy studios with rich libraries, but they’re not attached to a company with $65 billion in cash on hand and a device in the pockets of 1 billion people that also delivers bundle-friendly music, news, and games. Apple declined to confirm or comment on any numbers, but a source there suggested the subscriber number is higher than 45 million and that the global nature of the sub base is being undercounted by U.S.-oriented research firms. Maybe. The company reveals zero performance data beyond B.S. “biggest weekend ever!” press releases that the trades accept without skepticism and producers like Ben Stiller and David Ellison post with “blessed” emojis on their social media. No one outside the company really knows how the Apple TV+ business is performing.

The “Disaster” Scenario

Despite its size and capabilities, Apple still pushes the whole boutique-y, We’re the new HBO angle… to which the HBO people next door in Culver City often joke, Yeah, but people actually watch HBO. Indeed, the Nielsen Gauge report continues to omit Apple TV+, meaning that the service generates less than its reporting threshold of 1 percent of viewership on connected TVs. Hugely expensive, movie star–driven TV shows regularly land with little awareness or, presumably, viewers. Did you know Natalie Portman, Colin Farrell, Michael Douglas, Billy Crystal, and Warren Beatty all made shows for Apple this past year? They did! Well, except Warren Beatty… I made that one up, but you believed it because it sounds like someone Apple would work with."

Google’s latest pair of wireless earbuds are currently on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and the Google Store for $179, which is $50 off their usual list price of $229 (and their lowest price to date).



If you use an Android phone, and especially if you own a Pixel, these are the earbuds to get. Our reviewer called them “a compelling upgrade for Pixel users,” and praised their lightweight, small form factor, along with increased comfort and stability in the ear, so you can talk, walk, jog, or run and be confident that you won’t dislodge your buds. The latest model also offers better active noise cancellation, an improved transparency mode, and longer battery life — up to 12 hours with ANC off, and up to eight hours with it on.

There were bleeding-edge and eye-wateringly expensive platforms from the likes of Samsung or Apple, but for the more experimental among technophiles there was the Pebble. Based on a microcontroller and with a relatively low-resolution display, it was the subject of a successful crowdfunding campaign and became quite the thing to have. Now long gone, it has survived in open-source form, and now if you’re a Pebble die-hard you can even buy a new Pebble. We’re not sure about their choice of name though, we think calling something the “Core 2 Duo” might attract the attention of Intel’s lawyers.

The idea is broadly the same as the original, and remains compatible with software from back in the day. New are some extra sensors, longer battery life, and an nRF52840 BLE microcontroller running the show. It certainly captures the original well, however we’re left wondering whether a 2013 experience still cuts it in 2025 at that price. We suspect in that vein it would be the ideal compliment to your game controller when playing Grand Theft Auto V, another evergreen 2013 hit.

We look forward to seeing where this goes, and we reported on the OS becoming open source earlier this year. Perhaps someone might produce a piece of open source hardware to do the same job?"

Since Nothing's smartphone is targeting roughly the same group of smartphone buyers as the ‌iPhone 16e‌, we thought we'd do a comparison.

The ‌iPhone 16e‌ is priced at $599, which is higher than any other budget smartphone that Apple has released to date, while the 3a Pro is quite a bit more affordable at $459. The 3a Pro has some bells and whistles you won't get with the ‌iPhone 16e‌ like extra cameras and a larger display, but the Qualcomm chip in the 3a Pro really can't compete with the A18 in the ‌iPhone 16e‌. It's not even close

While the ‌iPhone 16e‌ has a 6.1-inch display, the 3a Pro has a larger 6.8-inch display, and it's notably larger and heavier. It has a brighter OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, while the 16e display is limited to 60Hz. In terms of design, the 16e has a classic, understated iPhone look with a single camera, while the 3a Pro has a large rear camera circle, a stylized mechanical look, and a ring of LED lights at the back that serve as notification alerts.

The Nothing Phone 3a Pro has an eye-catching design for sure, but it might also be a bit much for some people. There's a single 48-megapixel Wide camera in the ‌iPhone 16e‌, but the 3a Pro has a trio of cameras, including a 50-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel Telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom, and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide camera.

Battery life is about the same between the two, and the 3a Pro has no wireless charging feature while the 16e supports slow Qi-based wireless charging. The 3a Pro does charge faster though, because it supports up to 50W wired charging.

Nothing hasn't gone all in on AI like Apple, but there is a dedicated AI button that opens up the Essential Space, which is an AI-powered hub for notes, ideas, and inspirations. There are no image generation features or custom emoji, but it is a truly useful feature.

Of course, the major difference between the two is iOS vs. Android, so while the 3a Pro is a solid value with a good feature set, it's probably not going to lure ‌iPhone‌ users out of Apple's ecosystem.

What do you think of the Nothing Phone 3a Pro? Let us know in the comments below."

Axios reports that Apple is facing a federal lawsuit alleging that its “promotion of now-delayed Apple Intelligence features constituted false advertising and unfair competition.”

Apple Intelligence lawsuit

Apple Intelligence has played a key role in Apple’s marketing of the iPhone 16. The company has run ads promoting features including Image Playground, Genmoji, and Siri with personal context. After its decision to delay the feature, Apple pulled its ad promoting the more personalized Siri from YouTube. It also added new disclaimers to its website about the availability of the feature.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit note that Apple’s ads “saturated the internet, television, and other airwaves to cultivate a clear and reasonable consumer expectation that these transformative features would be available upon the iPhone’s release.”

Additionally:

Contrary to Defendant’s claims of advanced AI capabilities, the Products offered a significantly limited or entirely absent version of Apple Intelligence, misleading consumers about its actual utility and performance. Worse yet, Defendant promoted its Products based on these overstated AI capabilities, leading consumers to believe they were purchasing a device with features that did not exist or were materially misrepresented.

The plaintiffs acknowledge that Apple pulled the ad promoting the more personal Siri from YouTube, but still note the company “has failed to retract all the similarly false representations in the market that began in the Summer of 2024, much less take any action that would adequately remedy the consumers harmed by the company’s widespread deception.”

The lawsuit says that the promotion of Apple Intelligence features “drove unprecedented excitement” as Apple aimed to “convince consumers to upgrade at a premium price point.”

The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday in the U.S. District Court in San Jose. It seeks unspecified damages for people who purchased devices capable of running Apple Intelligence features. As Axios notes, the lawsuit was filed by Clarkson Law Firm, the same firm that “also sued Google and OpenAI over their AI practices.”

Unsurprisingly, finding an Apple-1 today is quite rare, especially one that still works. But someone has now bought an Apple-1 Computer for $375,000 at auction.

Rare Apple-1 Computer restored to operational condition

RR Auction confirmed on Friday the successful sale of the rare and historic Apple-1 Computer, which is still fully functional. The item was “meticulously restored” to operational condition by Corey Cohen, an expert in vintage Apple products. This particular machine is listed as #91 in the Apple-1 records.

The Apple-1 sold at the auction was rated an “exceptional” 8.0 out of 10 due to its “outstanding cosmetic preservation” and the “distinctly bright labeling on its integrated circuits.” The computer also has its original manual with handwritten notes referencing Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Daniel Kottke, which added more value to the product.

“Owning an Apple-1 is more than possessing a computer; it’s a piece of history—a direct connection to the groundbreaking vision of Jobs, Wozniak, and the pioneering team that transformed the world of technology,” said Bobby Livingston, Executive Vice President of RR Auction.

It offers three tiers, and its remained that way since it launched. However, I think Apple would benefit greatly from offering a fourth tier, capturing a key demographic.

Apple One tiers

Currently, Apple One offers three tiers: Individual, Family, and Premier.

Individual comes in at $19.95/month, offering Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV+, and 50GB of iCloud+ storage. Family comes in at $26.95/month, bumping up your iCloud+ storage to 200GB, and enabling family sharing for all of your services. Last but not least, Premier comes in at $37.95/month, giving users access to Apple Fitness+ and Apple News+, as well as a full 2TB of iCloud+ storage.

This system is mostly fine, and I don’t really have any complaints with the three tiers as they exist today. All that said, I think there’s great opportunity to introduce a fourth tier: one for students.

The precedent

Apple already sees the value in offering a student tier for services, given the fact that they do so with Apple Music. Apple Music normally comes in at $10.99/month, but verified college students can save around 50%, bringing the service down to just $5.99/month for them.

That alone is compelling enough, but Apple Music Student actually has a secret perk: free access to Apple TV+, indefinitely. It’s not a free trial. As long as you subscribe to Apple Music Student and Apple continues to offer the perk, you’ll have access to Apple TV+.

Technically speaking, this is a limited time perk. Apple’s website states that the offer “may end at any time.” However, Apple has been offering it for many years, ever since the service launched in late 2019.

Apple already has a low-scale student bundle going here, so why not expand it?

The proposal: Apple One Student

Apple One Student should remain simple. I think the most compelling package would likely be taking the individual plan and offering a discount for students. This way, students can access iCloud+ for backups and photo syncing, as well as Apple Arcade for casual gaming, on top of their already existing perks of Apple Music and Apple TV+.

Given the fact that Apple Music Student is priced at a 45% discount compared to the normal plan, we could estimate that a student version of Apple One Individual would come in around $10.95.

I don’t know about you, but that sounds like a pretty compelling offering to help Apple to bolster its subscriber numbers with a younger audience, especially when it comes to Apple Arcade.

Plus, when these students eventually graduate (or after 5 years, whichever comes first), they’re likely to stay subscribed to Apple One Individual since they’ve already gotten used to the perks. It’s a win win for both Apple and verified college students.

What do you think of this idea for students? Would you change anything about it? Let us know in the comments.

Apple,"Forget folding iPhones, Apple wants a foldable Apple Watch","Imagine being able to flip open the display on your Apple Watch, use it like an iPhone, and make video calls on it. That's what Apple's has been researching.Detail from the patent application showing a hinged Apple Watch screen — image Credit: AppleBack in th…",https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/03/20/forget-folding-iphones-apple-wants-a-foldable-apple-watch,2025-03-20T12:58:29Z,"Imagine being able to flip open the display on your Apple Watch, use it like an iPhone, and make video calls on it. That's what Apple's has been researching.

Back in the very earliest days of the Apple Watch, there was a manufacturing fault that meant the whole front display would come loose around three sides. It would then flap open along that last side, like a hinge.

Picture that happening again, but this time deliberately — and with at least one extra screen underneath the display. That's what is shown in a recently revealed Apple patent application called just ""Wearable Electronic Device.""

""[A] wearable electronic device, such as a smartwatch, can include a display with an extendable screen size,"" says Apple in the patent application. "" In particular, the display can be folded to be compact, and the display can be extended when increased screen size is desired.""

The text of the patent application refers to alternative options such as sliding the display to increase its size, but most of the illustrations show a hinged mechanism. One shows an Apple Watch display that can slide to a new angle, and also features a hinged second screen.

""A user may want the display to be extended when using certain applications, making phone/ video calls, playing games, browsing the web, etc,"" says Apple. ""On the other hand, the user may want the display to be folded for convenience and portability, such as when the user is going about their day-to-day activities, outdoor activities, etc.""

The proposal, filed in 2023, continues Apple's slow move to make the Apple Watch entirely independent of the iPhone. Initially, the Apple Watch was solely an adjunct to the iPhone, and it didn't even have a cellular edition until the Apple Watch Series 3 in 2018.

Then in 2019, Apple gave the device its own App Store. Anecdotally, that doesn't seem to have become much of a success, or encourage many app developers to return to watchOS.

But still the clear trajectory for the Apple Watch is for it to become a standalone device, and this patent application is a future step toward that.

""[It] allows users the flexibility to substitute the wearable electronic device for a smartphone for extended periods of time or for use in more routine activities typically performed with a smartphone,"" continues Apple. ""For example, the wearable electronic device of the present disclosure can provide intuitive access and enhanced usability of features for convenient video calling, camera usage, web browsing, messaging, and interfacing social media.""

Notice the video calling and camera usage part. Right now Apple Watch can be used as a viewfinder for the camera on the iPhone, but this patent application proposes putting an actual camera into the Apple Watch.

Or rather, putting two cameras into it. There could be ""an exterior camera,"" which the patent says could be used both when the Apple Watch is folded open or closed.

One other possible option is this combination of one sliding and one folding screen — image Credit: Apple

Plus an ""interior camera can allow the user to use the wearable electronic device for various applications such as video or conference calling.""

Given the size of an Apple Watch, and its position on a user's wrist instead of being held in their hand, there is an issue of durability. While the patent application does not address this, it's easy to imagine such a folded open screen as being potentially flimsy.

It is one of the most appealing Apple patent applications so far this year, but that doesn't mean we will ever get to see a folding Apple Watch come to market. There is some evidence that Apple has been considering a foldable Apple Watch for several years before the filing of this application, but the most that can be said is that the company is persisting in its research.

Apple applies for many hundreds of patents each year, and even when they are granted, it is not a guarantee that a product will follow.

Whereas it is pretty much a guarantee that should a folding version be launched, it could be a much more costly Apple Watch. Or at least, that seems likely given how the expected iPhone Fold is predicted to cost more than a Mac Studio."

""If you didn’t know an Air was coming, you'd swear it was a Google Pixel case,"" he said.



Case manufacturers often obtain design specifications of upcoming iPhone models before their release by collaborating with Apple through official partnerships or conducting on-site investigations in production facilities. Observing production trends and prototypes in these areas helps them anticipate design changes.

The upcoming iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a distinctive camera module design characterized by a horizontal ""camera bar"" that spans the width of the device's upper rear section. The design is reminiscent of Google's Pixel series and represents a departure from previous iPhone camera layouts.

Leaked renders suggest that the camera bar will house a single rear camera lens, positioned on the left side, with the flash located on the far right. The overall aesthetic is sleek and minimalist, in line with the iPhone 17 Air's ultra-thin profile, which is reported to be approximately 5.5mm thick.

Despite its minimalism, the device is expected to feature MagSafe, an Action button, and a Camera Control button – as indicated by the cutout on the lower left side of the case shown in the above image. A report at the weekend said the iPhone 17 Air will have a Camera Control button, and dummy models previously shared by Dickson reflect this.

The iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a 6.6-inch display with 120Hz ProMotion support, a Dynamic Island, a standard A19 chip rather than an A19 Pro chip, a 48-megapixel rear camera, Apple's custom-made C1 modem, and no physical SIM card slot worldwide. As usual, Apple should announce its new iPhone lineup around mid-September."
Apple,Next Year's iPhone 18 Pro Already Rumored to Have Five New Features,"While the iPhone 18 Pro models are still around a year and a half away from launching, there are already some early rumors about the devices.





Below, we recap some key iPhone 18 Pro rumors so far.



Under-Screen Face ID



In April 2023, display industry…",https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/iphone-18-pro-rumors/,2025-03-18T20:00:45Z,"While the iPhone 18 Pro models are still around a year and a half away from launching, there are already some early rumors about the devices.



Below, we recap some key iPhone 18 Pro rumors so far.



Under-Screen Face ID



In April 2023, display industry analyst Ross Young shared a roadmap showing that iPhone 17 Pro models would feature under-display Face ID. In May 2024, however, Young said he heard this change had been delayed until 2026. If so, that means that under-screen Face ID could debut on the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max next year.

Even with under-screen Face ID, it is expected that the Dynamic Island will live on, but it might become smaller. Alternatively, the iPhone 18 Pro models could have only a pinhole at the top of the display for the front camera, similar to Android smartphones like Google's Pixel 9 and Samsung's Galaxy S25. It's too early to know yet.



Variable Aperture



The main 48-megapixel Fusion camera on both iPhone 18 Pro models will offer variable aperture, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

With variable aperture, users would be able to control the amount of light that passes through the camera's lens and reaches the sensor. The main cameras on iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro models have a fixed aperture of ƒ/1.78, and the lens is always fully open and shooting with this widest aperture. With the iPhone 18 Pro models, users would be able to manually change the aperture, according to this rumor.

A variable aperture on iPhone 18 Pro models should provide users with greater control over depth of field, which refers to how sharp a subject appears in the foreground compared to the background. However, given that iPhones have smaller image sensors due to size restraints, it is unclear exactly how meaningful this improvement would be.



Samsung Image Sensor



Samsung is developing a new three-layer stacked camera sensor that Apple is expected to use for iPhone 18 Pro models, according to DigiTimes. This advanced image sensor would make the iPhone 18's camera more responsive, and offer other benefits like reduced noise in photos, increased dynamic range, and more.

The exact technology is called ""PD-TR-Logic,"" according to a leaker known as ""Jukanlosreve"", and it refers to a camera sensor with three layers of circuitry affixed to it.

Sony has long been the exclusive supplier of image sensors for iPhone cameras, so Samsung entering the fray would be notable.

In July 2024, Kuo said he expected Samsung to begin shipping 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera sensors to Apple for iPhones as early as 2026, which is when the iPhone 18 Pro models are expected to be released.



C2 Modem



Apple debuted its custom-designed C1 modem in the iPhone 16e last month, as part of a multi-year plan to transition away from Qualcomm modems.

Apple's second-generation C2 modem will debut in the iPhone 18 Pro models next year, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain. Unsurprisingly, expect the C2 modem to be faster than the C1, and for it to gain mmWave support in the United States. Further power efficiency improvements are likely too.



A20 Pro Chip With Apple Intelligence Upgrade



Apple's A20 Pro chip for the iPhone 18 Pro models will be manufactured with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process, despite an initial 2nm rumor, according to Pu. That is the same process that is expected to be used for the A19 Pro chip coming in the iPhone 17 Pro models, so the iPhone 18 Pro models could have relatively small overall performance improvements compared to the previous generation.

Pu does expect the A20 Pro chip to have one upgrade that he said will benefit Apple Intelligence capabilities. Specifically, he said the chip will use TSMC's so-called Chip on Wafer on Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology, which would allow for tighter integration of the chip's processor, unified memory, and Neural Engine."

Apple, on its System Status website, has said that the issues began today at 2.26pm ET, 11.26am PT and refers to the problem simply as “outages”.

The company says that “some user are affected” and that they might be experiencing “intermittent issues” with Apple Music.

Since this is a problem that appears to be affecting the streaming service, if you have offline music it should still be accessible on your device. If that is not the case, then your issue may be localized on your device rather than just being the result of this outage.

While this happened, and was officially announced around the 2pm mark, according to Downdetector, there was a rise in the number of users affected after that time, closer to 7pm.

This appears to not be a problem for everyone, so if you are struggling and can’t find much else to confirm your issues, know that you’re not alone.

Since this is on the radar for Apple expect the issue to be fixed sooner rather than later."

Bloomberg reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook “has lost confidence in the ability of AI head John Giannandrea to execute on product development.”

As such, Mike Rockwell, current vice president of the Vision Products Group and creator of Apple Vision Pro, is taking the reigns of the Siri team.

Giannanndrea is not leaving Apple, but Siri is being completely removed from his responsibilities. He will continue to oversee research, testing, and other AI-related technologies. Rockwell will report to Apple’s software boss, Craig Fderighi. According to the report, Giannanndrea “long considered Rockwell a potential successor.”

The report also says another “senior manager” from Rockwell’s team is moving to the Siri group:

In the past several days, Apple started moving over another senior manager from Rockwell’s team — Aimee Nugent — to the Siri group. Like Vorrath, she has a reputation for fixing challenging projects. The changes allowed two of Rockwell’s trusted executives to evaluate the organization before he became heavily involved. Inside Apple, Rockwell hasn’t been shy about criticizing Siri, according to people familiar with the matter. For years, he has pitched senior vice presidents on ideas for overhauling the voice assistant to make it more personalized. He has also been advising the AI group in recent weeks.

With Rockwell shifting to the Siri team, Paul Meade will take over the Apple Vision Pro team. Meade previously led hardware engineering for Vision Pro and worked under Rockwell.

Today’s news follows a report from The Information in April 2023 that described the internal turmoil plaguing the Siri team. Most notably, the report said that the Apple Vision Pro team had expressed frustration with Siri. Mike Rockwell even “considered building alternative methods for controlling the device using voice commands.”

The random baggage claim pins appear across Apple Maps on iPhone, iPad and Mac. This is obviously a glitch with the data being served by the Apple Maps backend, and should be fixable by Apple with a server update.

The bug was first spotted by Apple Maps users on Reddit about twenty-four hours ago. If you want to see it for yourself, open the Maps app and center your viewport around Chicago. Then, zoom out to the level where you can see state abbreviations and major cities.

At this zoom level, a handful of blue baggage claim pins will also be inexplicably visible, from a variety of airport terminals. With normal behavior, these POIs would only show up when you zoom in close to a particular airport, using the indoor maps features available at places like airports and major malls.

All in all, it’s a pretty harmless bug that Apple will inevitably be able to discreetly fix in due course. Still, it’s a bit weird that it randomly started happening in the last day or so.

There are now several sources who agree that Apple's first foldable iPhone will feature a 7.8-inch inner display when unfolded, along with a 5.5-inch outer display. Those sources include analysts Ming-Chi Kuo and Jeff Pu, along with the Weibo account Digital Chat Station. The fact that these display sizes are now agreed upon and have been leaked indicates that Apple may have finalized at least some of the device's specifications.

The foldable iPhone will open up like a book, according to Kuo, rather than have a clamshell design like Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip.

Pu said the foldable iPhone recently entered the New Product Introduction (NPI) stage at manufacturer Foxconn, suggesting that Apple is moving forward with plans to release the device. Pu and Kuo both believe that the foldable iPhone will enter mass production in the fourth quarter of 2026, which means the device could launch as soon as next year in limited quantities, but a release at some point in 2027 seems more likely.

As funny as it might sound, the foldable iPhone seems to be two years away for real this time.

Barclays analyst Tim Long recently estimated that Apple's first foldable iPhone could start at around $2,299 in the U.S., meaning it would cost nearly twice as much as the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which starts at $1,199 there.

In addition to the 7.8-inch inner display and 5.5-inch outer display, Kuo said the foldable iPhone will feature two rear cameras, one front camera, a Touch ID power button instead of Face ID, and a high-density battery. He expects the device to be as thin as 4.5mm when unfolded, and between 9mm and 9.5mm when folded. He also said the device will have a titanium exterior, but the hinge will use a mix of titanium and stainless steel."

Verizon today announced the launch of its satellite-based text service, which is available for select Android smartphone users through a partnership with Skylo. Skylo uses licensed mobile satellite spectrum that avoids interference with terrestrial signals to provide coverage in remote areas where there isn't traditional cellular signal.

Satellite texting through Verizon is only available for Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 9 smartphones, and unlike T-Mobile's Starlink integration, Verizon isn't able to expand the Skylo satellite texting option to iPhone users because it requires specific smartphone hardware.

‌iPhone‌ users with an ‌iPhone‌ 14 or later already have access to satellite-based texting as of iOS 18 using the ‌iPhone‌'s built-in satellite connectivity available through Globalstar, but the option to connect to satellites from a second satellite company could increase the chance of being able to communicate in remote and rural areas.

Apple added Starlink support to T-Mobile iPhones with iOS 18.3, and T-Mobile subscribers are able to connect to Starlink for satellite-based texting thanks to a public beta test that T-Mobile is offering. Compared to Apple's built-in satellite option, Starlink has more available satellites and smartphones can connect automatically without needing to hold a device up to the sky.

While Verizon's Skylo satellite texting isn't available on the ‌iPhone‌ right now, Verizon is working on other satellite technology. The company is partnering with AST SpaceMobile to offer customers direct-to-cellular AST SpaceMobile service when terrestrial mobile networks are unavailable. When Verizon's AST SpaceMobile satellite partnership is ready, Verizon will likely be able to offer satellite texting for both ‌iPhone‌ and Android users.

AST SpaceMobile and Verizon plan to provide satellite connectivity that supports text, voice, and video calling capabilities. AST SpaceMobile currently has FCC approval to test five commercial BlueBird satellites with smartphones."

Earlier this month, a Brazilian court ruled that Apple would have 90 days to allow sideloading on iOS for iPhone users in Brazil – but things are about to change. That’s because another judge has now ruled that Apple won’t have to implement the requested changes, at least for now.

Brazil won’t force Apple to enable sideloading, but regulator can still appeal

As reported by Brazilian newspaper Estadão (via MacMagazine) on Wednesday, a Federal Civil Court judge in Brazil has now ruled that Apple can continue distributing iOS apps exclusively through the App Store without letting developers opt for other platforms (a process known as sideloading).

In November last year, the Brazilian antitrust regulator “Cade” ruled that Apple should allow the distribution of apps outside the App Store in Brazil. The company would have 20 days to comply with the decision. Apple appealed the decision and a judge ruled that the injunction wasn’t necessary or urgent, giving the company more time to discuss the case.

After a public hearing with Apple and companies like Epic Games, the Brazilian court ordered Apple to allow sideloading within 90 days because it considered that the limitations imposed by the company could jeopardize the entry of new competitors in the segment. The court also claimed that Apple had implemented similar changes in the EU without a “significant impact or irreparable damage” to its business.

At the time, an Apple spokesperson said that the decision would “harm the privacy and security” of iOS users and that the company would appeal the decision. The appeal had a positive outcome for Apple, as the judge considered that the company was being punished as if it had been convicted, even though the case is not closed.

Of course, this doesn’t mean that Apple has won once and for all, but it certainly gives the company a lot more time to prepare for the next court battle. Someone who certainly isn’t happy with today’s result is Epic Games, which announced a few days ago that it would be launching Fortnite for iOS users in Brazil in July.

The Brazilian regulator can still appeal the judge’s decision.

It offers a fun way to create and share event invites with great Apple Photos and Apple Music integrations. Here are five features of the Invites app that you might have missed.

Quickly re-create event invites

If you host similar events regularly—maybe a book club, happy hour, or work meeting—you can quickly start a new invite by duplicating a previous one.

Just open the event you want to copy, tap the three dots in the top-right corner, and hit Duplicate.

The guest list of the original event won’t be copied over, so you’ll need to manually add recipients again. But otherwise, duplicating the event will give you a nice head start on the new invite.

Customize your notifications

If you enable push notifications for the Invites app, Apple lets you further customize the types of notifications you receive with five total options. Tap your profile picture in the top-right corner of the app, then Push Notifications, and you’ll see toggles for the following notification categories:

Events you’re hosting

Events you’re invited to

Recommendations

New features and tips

Offers

If you prefer to get email alerts instead of push notifications (or in addition to them), there’s an option for that too. By tapping your profile picture you’ll find an Email Updates menu, where you can toggle on email alerts for events you’re hosting and/or ones you’re invited to.

Privacy features for events

Apple offers a variety of privacy-conscious features inside the Invites app. These include the ability to:

require approval for all RSVPs before they’re confirmed

hide key details until guests are confirmed, such as location, guest list, event background image, and more

create one-time-use invites personalized for specific guests, or use a generic link that works for anyone

Additionally, if you receive an invite, your personal contact information won’t be visible to other guests, and you can choose how your name and image are displayed.

Special guest permissions

Just as you might expect from an app like Invites, Apple’s app lets you decide whether to allow guests to add their own guests to the event.

But the Invites app goes a bit further too. In addition to the all-or-nothing invite permission that applies to all guests, you can also get more granular and allow only certain guests to make their own invites. This can be done by opening the guest list, then tapping the three dots next to a person and hitting ‘Allow to invite others.’

Draft in advance and save your work

Like to plan ahead? Apple’s Invites app fully supports that. When creating new invites, you don’t have to send them right away. Instead, you can create as many drafts as you’d like and save them for later.

When you’re ready to send, just visit the Drafts section of the app, make any last-minute changes, and send the invite.

Also, if you get an invite completely ready to go but want to schedule it for later, the scheduling features included in Apple’s Messages and Mail apps have you covered.

Apple Invites app feature wrap-up

For a freshly arrived app, Apple Invites feels especially full-featured. There are always things Apple could add later, such as even more app integrations (cost-splitting with Wallet, perhaps?). But what’s available in this early version is impressive and meets all the basic needs most users will have—and then some.
